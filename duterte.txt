President Fidel Ramos, sir, salamat po sa tulong mo making me President; President Joseph Ejercito Estrada; Senate President Franklin Drilon and the members of the Senate; Speaker Feliciano Belmonte and the members of the House of Representatives; Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno and Associate Justices of the Supreme Court; His Excellency Guiseppe Pinto and the members of the Diplomatic Corps; incoming members of the Cabinet; fellow workers in government; my fellow countrymen.

No leader, however strong, can succeed at anything of national importance or significance unless he has the support and cooperation of the people he is tasked to lead and sworn to serve.

It is the people from whom democratic governments draw strength and this administration is no exception. That is why we have to listen to the murmurings of the people, feel their pulse, supply their needs and fortify their faith and trust in us whom they elected to public office.

There are many amongst us who advance the assessment that the problems that bedevil our country today which need to be addressed with urgency, are corruption, both in the high and low echelons of government, criminality in the streets, and the rampant sale of illegal drugs in all strata of Philippine society and the breakdown of law and order. True, but not absolutely so. For I see these ills as mere symptoms of a virulent social disease that creeps and cuts into the moral fiber of Philippine society. I sense a problem deeper and more serious than any of those mentioned or all of them put together. But of course, it is not to say that we will ignore them because they have to be stopped by all means that the law allows.

Erosion of faith and trust in government – that is the real problem that confronts us. Resulting therefrom, I see the erosion of the people’s trust in our country’s leaders; the erosion of faith in our judicial system; the erosion of confidence in the capacity of our public servants to make the people’s lives better, safer and healthier.

Indeed ours is a problem that dampens the human spirit. But all is not lost.

I know that there are those who do not approve of my methods of fighting criminality, the sale and use of illegal drugs and corruption. They say that my methods are unorthodox and verge on the illegal. In response let me say this:

I have seen how corruption bled the government of funds, which were allocated for the use in uplifting the poor from the mire that they are in.

I have seen how illegal drugs destroyed individuals and ruined family relationships.

I have seen how criminality, by means all foul, snatched from the innocent and the unsuspecting, the years and years of accumulated savings. Years of toil and then, suddenly, they are back to where they started.

Look at this from that perspective and tell me that I am wrong.

In this fight, I ask Congress and the Commission on Human Rights and all others who are similarly situated to allow us a level of governance that is consistent to our mandate. The fight will be relentless and it will be sustained.

As a lawyer and a former prosecutor, I know the limits of the power and authority of the president. I know what is legal and what is not.

My adherence to due process and the rule of law is uncompromising.

You mind your work and I will mind mine. [applause and cheers]

“Malasakit;” “Tunay na Pagbabago; Tinud-anay (real) nga Kausaban (change)” – these are words which catapulted me to the presidency. These slogans were conceptualized not for the sole purpose of securing the votes of the electorate. “Tinud-anay nga kabag-uhan (real change). Mao kana ang tumong sa atong pang-gobyerno (this is the direction of our government).”

Far from that. These were battle cries articulated by me in behalf of the people hungry for genuine and meaningful change. But the change, if it is to be permanent and significant, must start with us and in us.

To borrow the language of F. Sionil Jose, we have become our own worst enemies. And we must have the courage and the will to change ourselves.

Love of country, subordination of personal interests to the common good, concern and care for the helpless and the impoverished – these are among the lost and faded values that we seek to recover and revitalize as we commence our journey towards a better Philippines. The ride will be rough. But come and join me just the same. Together, shoulder to shoulder, let us take the first wobbly steps in this quest.

There are two quotations from revered figures that shall serve as the foundation upon which this administration shall be built.

“The test of government is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide for those who have little.”
– Franklin Delano Roosevelt

And from (Abraham) Lincoln I draw this inspiration:

“You cannot strengthen the weak by
weakening the strong; You cannot help
the poor by discouraging the rich; You
cannot help the wage earner by pulling down the wage payer; You cannot further the brotherhood by inciting class hatred among men.”

My economic and financial, political policies are contained in those quotations, though couched in general terms. Read between the lines. I need not go into specifics now. They shall be supplied to you in due time.

However, there are certain policies and specifics of which cannot wait for tomorrow to be announced.

Therefore, I direct all department secretaries and the heads of agencies to reduce requirements and the processing time of all applications, from the submission to the release. I order all department secretaries and heads of agencies to remove redundant requirements and compliance with one department or agency, shall be accepted as sufficient for all.

I order all department secretaries and heads of agencies to refrain from changing and bending the rules government contracts, transactions and projects already approved and awaiting implementation. Changing the rules when the game is on-going is wrong.

I abhor secrecy and instead advocate transparency in all government contracts, projects and business transactions from submission of proposals to negotiation to perfection and finally, to consummation.

Do them and we will work together. Do not do them, we will part sooner than later.

On the international front and community of nations, let me reiterate that the Republic of the Philippines will honor treaties and international obligations.

On the domestic front, my administration is committed to implement all signed peace agreements in step with constitutional and legal reforms.

I am elated by the expression of unity among our Moro brothers and leaders, and the response of everyone else to my call for peace.

I look forward to the participation of all other stakeholders, particularly our indigenous peoples, to ensure inclusivity in the peace process.

Let me remind in the end of this talk, that I was elected to the presidency to serve the entire country. I was not elected to serve the interests of any one person or any group or any one class. I serve every one and not only one.

That is why I have adapted as an article of faith, the following lines written by someone whose name I could no longer recall. He said:

“I have no friends to serve, I have no enemies to harm.”

Prescinding there from, I now ask everyone, and I mean everyone, to join me as we embark on this crusade for a better and brighter tomorrow.

But before I end, let me express the nations, on behalf of the people, our condolences to the Republic of Turkey of what has happened in the place. We offer our deepest condolences.

Why am I here? Hindi kasali ito diyan. The past tense was, I am here because I love my country and I love the people of the Philippines. I am here, why? Because I am ready to start my work for the nation.

Thank you and good afternoon.

Sinadya ko po na pagkatapos na ako’y mag-oath kanina bilang Presidente ng Pilipinas, sinadya ko ‘yung simpleng reception lang. Gusto ko po magtipid, pero sabi ko sa mga tauhan natin na mag-tipid tayo, pero huwag nating kalimutan ‘yung ibang kapatid natin nasa labas na hindi makapasok ng Malacañang.

May bagong patakaran po ako: ‘Yung Malacañang po ay pwede na kayong pumasok. Unahin lang po natin ‘yung mga bata, mga kindergarten hanggang grade high school, para makita naman nila kung ano ‘yung Palasyo.

Unahin po natin ‘yung mga bata at pagkatapos kayo, kung panahon na ninyo, naubos na ‘yung mga estudyante, at panahon na ninyo pumunta, magdala na lang ho kayo ng kumot at unan at pwede na kayong matulog doon.

Ngayon, kung buong Maynila po mayaya ko at makapasok po sa Malacañang, pwede ho buong Maynila. Doon tayo matulog. Kaya lang mag-tindig lang kayo na tutulog. [tawanan] At marami ho talaga.

Pupunta ho tayo dito sa ating bayan. Alam naman ho ninyo na tumakbo ako kasi hindi ko na talaga masikmura ‘yung dumaan ng mga official sa gobyerno. Wala naman po akong tinutukoy na isang tao. But, hindi ko na ho alam kong anong gagawin ko at nakikita ko ang bayan ko, lunod na lunod po sa droga, kriminalidad at walang mga pera, at wala ring pumapasok dito na mga negosyante kasi takot sa sitwasyon natin. Kailangan ho tayo magbago. There has to be a change, not only sa gobyerno, but kayo rin ho ang tao, sabay-sabay tayo.

At ipangako ko sa inyo na kung kayo’y sumunod lang sa gobyerno at makipag-tulungan sa amin, gagarantiyahan ko kayo na aangat ang buhay natin. At lahat ng pera sa gobyerno na para sa tao, talagang mapunta sa tao. At ang unahin ko po, ‘yung ating edukasyon. Sisikapin ko na lahat kayo, mga anak ninyo makapagaral at ‘yung pera ng gobyerno, una ho kayo sa edukasyon.

Pangalawa ho, ang aking programa sa healthcare ng tao. Ang kalagayan ng inyong katawan. Karamihan po, at pumunta kayo ng mga ospital, binibigyan kayo ng reseta para sa sakit ninyo, at hindi naman nabibili kasi po naman talaga ang karamihan sa atin ay hirap lang. Kung ikaw nasa ospital ka, at tapos wala kang pambayad sa ospital, kung hindi mo mabili ‘yung gamot, ayon na, nagkakaproblema na ho tayo.

Ang masakit lang ho sa akin, at marami naman ‘yung pera ng gobyerno, at bakit naman hindi dumadating sa tao. Kaya ho, simula nitong administrasyon ko, ‘tong araw na ‘to, lahat po ng kinita ng sugal, mga casino, pag-aari ng gobyerno, lahat ang kinikita niyan — at bilyon-bilyon ‘yan — pupunta ‘yan sa tao para sa mga medisina at ospital ninyo.

At hindi na ho matakot ang ospital na malugi sila o hindi sila mabayaran because I have directed na ‘yung kita ng PAGCOR (Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation) – paiba-iba ho ‘yung sa mga taong dumaan, mayroong isang taon kumikita tayo ng 35 billion, minsan naman 32 [billion], but hindi ho bumaba ‘yan sa 30 [billion].

Palagay ko sa 30 billion, at least tayo makabili na ng mga medisina ninyo at ang karamihan po naman sakit ng ating mga kapatid na medyo may edad na, may mga high blood, diabetes, kidney, ‘yung iba may cancer. E palagay ko ho naman sa kalaki-laking pera niyan, at may hati kayo diyan. Pati paghati-hatian ng lahat ng ospital ng buong Pilipinas, at mabigyan ho kayo ng medisina.

Ang pangatlo pong importante sa akin, ‘yung pong agrikultura kasi pagkain ‘yan. Kailangan ho tayong magtanim. Kasi kung tayo-tayo lang, ang Pilipinas wala na pong resources. At ‘yung ating mga malalaking lupa sa Mindanao, at naagaw na sa mga korporasyon na multinational, e sila na ho ang nakikinabang sa lupa at halos ‘yung magagandang lupa ng Mindanao ay puro ho banana, puro pineapple at kung ano-anong prutas na ipinapalabas natin sa bansa. Ibig sabihin, ang yumayaman niyan, ang karamihan, ‘yung mga korporasyon na ang may mga pag-aari hindi ho Pilipino. At wala na ho tayong mga lupang matamnan natin ng bigas for food.

Karamihan ho, ang ating mga lupa ang kinikita ang cash crop para ipagbili sa labas. Wala na ho tayong food crop, pero magbalik ho tayo at ‘yung lahat na nawala sa land reform, gusto ko maibalik doon sa mga tenant at maghanap ako ng program.

Karamihan ho noon, pagdating ‘nong land reform na ibigay doon sa tenant, manggagawa, sa panahon ho, pinagbili uli doon sa may-ari ng lupa sa landowner. Pero wala naman akong magawa, talagang kung gusto ng tao ipagbili niya, wala na tayong magawa diyan. Ang konswelo ko na lang na iyong mga tenants, ‘yung mga trabahante ho sa mga farms, at least lang sa isang panahon sa buhay nila nakatikim sila ng malaking pera. Okay na sa’kin ‘yun.

Pero hanapan ho natin ng paraan na ‘yung ipinagbili maibalik at dito nga ngayong panahon na ito, tutulungan sila ng gobyerno. At ‘yung kita nila sa lupa, kung anong klaseng produkto, bibilihin ng gobyerno para sigurado magkaroon sila ng kita sa lupa nila.

Dito naman sa baba, maghanap ako ng isang malaking pera, isang milyon isang region, at ‘yun po ang ibibigay kong mga tulong sa mga farmers. Pangbili nila ng kanilang seedling, fertilizer, at kung ano, baka carabao, o mechanized farming, kung kaya natin.

Dito ho sa urban — rural ‘yun bukid — dito sa urban ho, may tinatawag tayong small and medium industries. ‘Yung mga tao na ilagay ko po diyan, ‘yun yung nagpapatakbo ng ‘Go Negosyo.’ ‘Yan ‘yung mga pera na ibinibigay konti-konti na makapag-isip kayo ng magandang negosyo para sa inyong mga anak.

Karamihan mga anak ninyo, walang trabaho at walang makita, at ‘yung tingnan naming may utak, at kaya niyang magtayo ng negosyo, mabigyan ng kapital. Itong pera na ito, hindi ito konsumo. Ipapasok siya ng negosyo at ‘yung kita niya babayaran niya. Pero, malawak ito. Kasi sabi ko, isauli ko ‘yung pera sa inyo dahan-dahan, ang hiningi ko lang naman, e bayaran ho ninyo, kasi para ‘yung pera, masauli sa kamay ng gobyerno at magamit ko sa ibang kapwa tao ninyo Pilipino, para lumawak at sana naman ho, maski na papano, may negosyo kayo ng sarili ninyo.

Marami ho akong gustong isabi, mauubos ang gabi nito. Pero, ngayon ho, magtayo ako ng hotline. Ang number na hinihingi ko po sa Smart pati Globe: 8888. Kung may reklamo kayo — nandyan yan sa Malacañang — kung kayo’y inabuso, kung kayo’y pinagsamantalahan, kung may hindi kayo nagustuhan sa gobyerno, tumawag kayo day and night at ‘yung mga importanteng problema, nakikita ko. Aksyunan ko kaagad. Kung hindi ko tawagan ‘yung mayor, tawagan ko ‘yung barangay captain ninyo at ‘yung pulis. Kung ‘yung pulis naman ho ang nirereklamo ninyo tawagan mo ako. ‘Wag lang ninyo akong… ‘wag lang ho kayong magsinunglaing. Just tell me the truth. ‘Wag kayong mag-imbento ng istorya. Pati ‘yung totoo ‘yung reklamo mo sa gobyerno, kung talaga ikaw naman ay walang kain nitong araw na ito ay ‘di madali ‘yan at marami tayong paraan kung paano ako makatulong.

Basta nandyan ‘yang 8888, apat na 8. ‘Yun ang tawagan ninyo. Kung gusto mo lang manligaw ng operator na babae, tawagan mo lang. Kaya ‘wag ka lang… Wag mo ubusin ang panahon ng gobyerno. Tama na ‘yang magsabi: “Operator ba ‘to? Maganda ka ba? I love you.” Okay na ‘yan ha?

So ‘yan ang mga pangako ko noon na ngayon bumalik ako para sabihin sa inyo, tutuparin ko ‘yan. [palakpakan] Ako po’y nahalal na Presidente ng Pilipinas at kung maniniwala kayo kung totoo o hindi, ganito ‘yan: Tumakbo ho ako, wala ako ni isang mayor ng siyudad ng Pilipinas. Wala ho akong barangay captain ni isa labas ng Davao City. Wala na ako. Zero. Wala ho akong congressman, senador o kagawad o tanod. But, in spite of that, ako’y inyong hinalal at alam ko kung ano ang mensahe ninyo.

Hindi ninyo ako kilala. Small time mayor lang ako ng Mindanao, siyudad ng Davao. Hindi ninyo alam ang record ko. Pero ang mga mensahe naibigay ko sa inyo, ‘yun alam ko ang hiningi ninyo — kahirapan, korapsyon sa gobyerno, pati droga at kriminalidad.

Ako mag-pranka ako sa inyo. Dito sa panahon ko, tatapusin ko ‘yang problema sa droga. Sinisira ang bayan natin at ang mga anak natin na susunod sa atin dito sa mundong ito, sinisira ng mga putang inang ito.

Ako po’y galit. Pati ‘yung mga pulis dito sa Maynila, nakasabit sa droga. Ako po’y nakikiusap, huwag ho kayong pumasok diyan kasi papatayin ko talaga kayo. Hindi man siguro ngayong gabi, hindi man siguro bukas, pero sa anim na taon, may isang araw ka talaga magkamali ka at hihiritan kita.

Hindi naman ho ako natatakot, duwag naman ako na pagkatao, ayaw ko rin mamatay. Pero pag ‘yan ang gusto ninyo, ibibigay ko sa inyo. Kaya kayong mga droga, tapos na ako nag-warning ‘nong eleksyon. Kung anong mangyari sa inyo, makinig kayong lahat, baka kapatid mo ‘yan, asawa mo, kaibigan mo, anak mo, ipapasabi ko na sa inyo, walang sisihan. Sinabi ko na sa inyong huminto kayo. Ngayon, pag may mangyari ho sa kanila, ginusto nila ‘yan. Ginusto nila. [palakpakan]

Kung ‘yung asawa mo naman adik, wala naman ginagawa kung hindi kumain ng hindi niya gastos; nagnanakaw, nagho-hold up para sa droga. Hindi kaya mabuti na lang tatapusin na natin ang purgatoryo nila. Tama?

Kaya ‘yung mga kapital na ibigay ko sa inyo. Maliliit lang naman sabi ko ‘yung mga anak ninyo baka gusto nilang mag-negosyo, grupo sila at bagong graduate. Instead of going to drugs, you might want to put up a business. Sabihin ko sa inyo, itong mga panahon, itong mga araw na dadating, kung may punerarya ho kayo, kikita kayo nang husto.

‘Yung mga small time punerarya dito, doon, at sigurado hindi kayo malugi. At pag humihina na ang negosyo ninyo, sabihin ko lang sa mga pulis, bilis-bilisan ninyo nang konti para kumita ‘yung tao sa negosyo nila. Sinasabi ko na sa inyo. Hindi ako nagbibiro. Talagang galit ako sa droga. Sinisira ang bayan ko. Mahal ko ang bayan ko. Mahal ko kayo. [palakpakan]

And the next generation, mga anak natin, iilan taon lang, kailan lang nga, Mayor lang ako ng Davao. Kailan ba ‘yung may balita na tatakbo ako, ‘di naman niyo ako kilala. Outside of Davao ‘yung mukha ko, kung pumasok ako dito, ‘di niyo ako kilala ‘nong estudyante pa kami. May mga pista pista dito, na nayayaya naman kami kumain kaya alam ko ang buhay dito. Alam ko marami ang Bisaya dito. ‘Yung mga migrants galing sa—

Tulungan ho ninyo sana ako. Simple lang hiningi ko: Bayan na komportable ‘yung tao. Walang gutom. At kung maari lang po, may hanap buhay lahat. ‘Yun lang ang hiningi ko sa Diyos, na ‘wag masyadong pahirapan ang Pilipino, napakarami ho natin. At kung ganito lang tayo palagi, kuntento na kayo dyan, hindi ko ho naman kayo minamaliit. Ako po’y anak ng mahirap. Kami po’y pumunta ng Mindanao kasi mahirap ho sa Cebu.

Ang oportunidad ho napakasikip. Ang Tatay ko po’y sundalo noon, abogado pero sa sa JAGO (Judge Advocate General’s Office). ‘Yun ho ‘yung parang korte ng mga militar. Pagkatapos ng giyera, naging Mayor siya sa Danao, Danao City na ‘yan ngayon. Right after the war, na Mayor ang tatay ko sa Danao, at ganun rin ang hirap ng buhay, hindi talaga kaya at rumarami kami na magkapatid.

Kaya dinala niya kami doon sa Mindanao at napakahirap ang buhay namin sa umpisa. At siya naman po’y naging gobernador. Sa awa ng Diyos, ‘yung anak niya ako, naging mayor. At ‘yung anak ko naman na babae, ngayon ang mayor, ang vice mayor yung kapatid niyang lalaki. Baka dynasty ho talaga. Hindi ko na talaga mapigilan ‘yan.

Pero sa totoo lang, alam naman ninyo ang Mindanao. May problema tayo sa Moro. Alam mo kasi, ang lola ko sa nanay ko, Maranao. Ang lolo ko sa nanay ko, Intsik, Chinese. Kaya naman ako labas pasok sa NPA (New People’s Army), sa mga moro at ako’y nakikiusap noon pa kung pwede aregluhin natin itong problema natin, para masagana ang buhay. I’m trying to strike a peace deal with the Communist Party of the Philippines, nag-uusap ho kami.

Ako po’y unang president ng Pilipinas na galing sa left. Left po ako. [palakpakan] Ang partido ko po sa umpisa, 1988, Bayan po ako.

Kayo ho naman ngayon, nandito na ako sa pwesto at para sa ating bayan, talagang nakikiusap ako, pati doon sa ating mga kapatid na Moro, si Murad pati si Misuari na sana po’y umupo sila, kami at mag-usap na lang ng kapayapaan.

Ginagawa ho na namin ‘yan ngayon at ako po’y humihingi ng tulong kay Allah na tulungan tayong lahat. At pag na-plantsa po ito –‘yung pera na ibibili ko ng bala pati bomba at patayin ‘yung mga kapatid nating Moro, pati mga NPA – magamit ko na ho sa lahat ng bagay para makapabuti sa inyong lahat.

I find it hard to magpirma ho ako ng resibo na bibili ako ng bomba, pati mortar, pati bala para patayin ko lang ang kapwa ko Pilipino. Napakahirap po. Kaya sana ‘yung pera na ibili ko ng mga bala, ibili ko na lang kung anong maitulong ko sa inyong bahay, resettlement at pati itong trapik ng Maynila.

Kaya kayong mga carnapper, para wala na masadyong trapik, kung sana po manakaw lang ninyo lahat ng sasakyan diyan, nakawin na ninyo at dalhin niyo sa ibang lugar na wala masyadong trapik. Napakahirap ho ang problema na ‘yan at kami po sa gobyerno ay humihingi ng ilang buwan para ma-plantsa namin kung ano ang dapat naming gawin.

So hindi lang ho ‘yan, pati airport ho. Isa lang ang airport ng Maynila, lahat ng eroplano, sakay ang mga tao na pumupunta dito. Kaya kami late doon kasi minsan sa runway, umaabot kami, nagpipila kami. Almost one hour. Kasi pag limang eroplano, landing na naman muna, stop ka, take-off na naman, tapos landing. ‘Yun ang nangyari sa atin, napabayaan ang problema sa ating bayan. Hindi na nga ako magtatagal, nandito lang po ako.

Gusto ko lang naman mag-celebrate sa inyo, makakain lang man tayo lahat [palakpakan] para magpasalamat sa inyo, na kung wala kayo hindi talaga ako dadating sa saan– Kaninang umaga at ako’y nag-oath na bilang Presidente. ‘Di ko talaga akalain. Sinasabi ko sa’yo wala akong makinarya, wala akong leader, wala lahat. But, kayong hindi maniwala ng Diyos, sinasabi ko na sa inyo ngayon, merong Diyos at may milagro.

‘Yung pagkapanalo ko po ay destiny ‘yan. Diyos ang may gusto ‘non, hindi ako. Kahit saan mo bilangin, maski dito sa Tondo, wala akong isang leader kung hindi kayo, kayo mismo ang tumanggap sa akin. Walang leader, leader.

Ayaw ko kayong biguin at ako naman hindi masyado mahilig diyan sa promise promise. Pag nagbitaw ako ng salita, ‘yun na yun. Wala ng atrasan ‘yan. So maraming salamat at magtiis-tiis lang po kayo nang konti at tulungan ninyo ako sa gobyerno.

‘Yung mga adik ho diyan, kayo na lang ho ang pumatay. Kung anak niya, ikaw ang pumatay. Kung anak niyang adik, kayo ang pumatay para hindi masyadong masakit. Unahin na lang muna niya, kasi darating talaga ‘yan. Mamamatay ‘yan. Pag nandiyan ‘yan, pabili nang pabili nang pabili. Sabihin ko sa inyo: 365 days a year, may isang araw talaga na magkamali ‘yan. Pagdating niyan. ‘Wag ho tayong magsisihan kasi nasabi ko na sa inyo.

Maraming salamat po.

Kindly sit down. Thank you.

Troop Commander, give the order of tikas pahinga.

The Vice President Leni Robredo, this is my first time to meet you personally [applause].

I would have preferred to be seated beside you but nandiyan si Defense (Secretary Delfin Lorenzana) e [laughter] President Fidel V. Ramos, the first Filipino who journeyed to Davao City to ask me to run for public office and president [applause] and he said to me “you run because it is high time that Mindanao should have its president.” Maraming salamat sa’yo, sir. [applause]; Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, we were together in Davao many years ago and of course that is why I chose him kasi siya ‘yung kilala ko. ‘Yung iba hindi ko kilala, so — Lt. Gen Glorioso Miranda, sir, please sit down, sir, napapahiya ako. [laughter]; Bishop Leopoldo Tumulak; the members of the diplomatic corps; major service commanders; and the men and women of the Armed Forces of the Philippines; members of the Foreign Armed Forces Attaches; fellow workers in government; my beloved country men.

Alam mo, the first job of a president is not to go to war but rather to bring peace to his land. So even before I was already a proclaimed but before assumption of office, I was busy going around Mindanao and talking to a lot of people to bring about peace in our land. Started with the left and with the NPAs (New People’s Army), and we got a favorable answer from the leaders, including Jose Maria Sison.

Alam mo, it was in the 1970s na nakinig ako kay Jose Maria Sison talking about revolution and I was then in the AB, and half of it, well, of course, sa College of Law. And I am now 71 years old and the Communist Party [of the Philippines] is still talking of a revolution. Kaya sinabi ko sa kanila initially, anong gusto ninyo sa bayan natin? I was a student, ako lolo na ako ngayon at naging presidente pa. I don’t know really why, you have to supply the answer. Maybe President (Fidel) Ramos can give us an idea.

Well, we got this favorable response from the outside and we started to talk. Well to the camp of Murad and started to talk to the central committee and Jafar. And since Nur [Misuari] is a friend of mine, and I said: “Nur, we’re about to go. Matanda na tayong dalawa. Are we still going to fight at this time?”

My job is to bring peace. My job is to talk to the enemies of the state, to the Communist Party of the Philippines, to the MILF (Moro Islamic Liberation Front), and to the men, and see if I could make a difference in our lives. Alam mo, hindi ko sinali ang Abu Sayyaf, neither dito o sa criminal campaign natin, because the Abu Sayyaf is closely connected with the issue of Mindanao. Originally, mga tao sila ito ng MN[LF], pati mga anak na ‘yung MN[LF] pati MI[LF] and that was where the futility (unclear) in the Mindanao issue.

Simply stated: They’re claiming the historical right and more privileges for them. And I cannot blame them. You know when [Ferdinand] Magellan landed in Leyte in 1521, bringing Christianity with him and propagated it everywhere in the Visayas and Luzon. 100 years before, Sulu area and some parts of Mindanao were already Islam.

That is why a lot of the historical planners never really took into the consideration that there was this oppression by series of government na hindi kanila. And they think that until now, we’re trying to repress them. And I said to them: You know you cannot drive us away anymore. Kagaya ko at pati ‘yung mga anak ko, half of us are really moro already. I have a bunch of my family, my little boys and girls who are Moro.

And so I, it behooves upon me and I think to really look for the answer and I can hack it, and if can talk to Maria Sison and bring about — not a coalition government — an inclusive government. They are there already. And I said that so long as the powers that would pertain to matters belonging to the police and the military, hindi ho sa inyo ‘yan. The tall orders, the mundane matters of governance I can give it to you and we are talking. Next week, we are to talk to the MI[LF] and eventually I think I’ll have to travel to Jolo to talk to Nur [Misuari]. I’m willing to give them safe conduct passes, only the leaders. At baka matyambahan ko na magkaroon tayo ng mapayapa. And if that happens really, I can retire happy and I can look back and say that I did my duty in nation building. [applause]

It is not a war to be fought forever. We cannot fight forever. We might have the weapons, the armaments, and the bullets, mortars, but does not make any (unclear).

My job is to bring peace but hand in hand I must also bring order in my country. Alam mo sa totoo lang, we can only take so much. I am not warning Abu Sayyaf but I said there will always be a time for reckoning.

Just keep our fingers crossed. And I said we can only swallow so much. We cannot be weeping boy of the few who wants nothing but maybe money and power in their hands. And so also with the problem now, a very serious problem of the country. Saan ka nakakita dito ng gobyerno na ang trafficking ng drugs is being controlled inside the Bilibid prison? At parang sampal ‘yan nang ilang beses. And how it came about into being is really, well I would know, said in neglect.

How can it happen na kung mag-inspection ka sa Bilibid, you have to ask permission from the idiot inside. Ay nako. This is my first day. I’m warning them there, they have the TVs there inside. Napasyal ako noon, pagpasok ko I was there to see– I accompanied Pastor [Apollo] Quiboloy to pray over kay [Hubert] Webb, ‘yung anak ni [Freddie] Webb who was in Muntinlupa. At pagdaan ko doon sa death row:

“Uy mayor, mayor.” Akala ko naman taga-Davao. Sabi ko: Ang rami niyong taga-Davao nakulong ah. Sabi nila: Hindi mayor, Ilocano kami e. Halo halo, mga waray. Nakikita ka namin sa TV.

Well the TV is there now. Magbilang kayo ng araw.Magbilang kayo ng araw.Sa ginagawa ninyo. Do not be the solution of it all. May problema diyan. Hinihiya ninyo ang gobyerno.Sinasampal ninyo kami. Magbilang kayo ng oras. Ayaw ko ng araw. [Laughter and applause]

The drugs must be suppressed. It cannot be eliminated. For as long as the greed for money is there, the very corrosive effect of money has sudden impact on our society. There are a lot of people, these lives destroyed using it and nor they were in the rural areas. Now we have reached the hinterlands, and they are getting the carabaos, and the pigs and the chickens and the eggs.

Well, nakikinig naman ‘yung mga NPA, nasa pwesto pa naman kayo. Ano kaya ‘yung korte nito,‘yung korte ninyo. Korte ninyo, I don’t know if it’s a kangaro or otherwise. E, patayin nalang ninyo para mas madali ang masolusyon angproblema natin.

nyway, kung maengkwentro ninyo ‘yan, it’s always a crime… crime committed in your presence. You do not shoot anybody just because you see them walking, but I know you have this validation. Ekung diyan sa bukid, tapusin na ninyo yan mas mabuti wala narin kayong ginagawa.

There is slow down in the fighting. Why should we be fighting? And as matter of fact, I’m just awaiting for the arrival of Sison to talk to him and maybe, just maybe in the fullness of God’s time, we can have peace amongst us. ‘Yung mga droga ay malala. And I have to call in the Armed Forces of the Philippines to help. Sadly gusto ko sanang ang inyong Board of Generals will be a vibrant entity within the organization as I have promised and as was my practice during my mayorship days, I never interfered. Kung ano ang trabaho ng pulis, I did not even want to entertain ‘yung request for… assignment of a certain police officer in the barangays. I’d always tell them: Go to the police director. I do not want to interfere (unclear).

The best support that they can give you and you can ask anybody, lahat‘yan sila ngayon sa gobyerno nagdala-dala ko.

There once upon a time city, police directors and — well the performance was there. Lahat naman mababait at mahusay except for a few and in this, our society now, nagbabaha ‘yung droga and drug lords and the criminals.

There are a lot of Chinese citizens, Filipino or otherwise, kidnap, ransom demanded but they were never really returned. So tinapon lang nila kung saan, ilibing nila kung—
These are the things that we have to stop and that is why I said I would be harsh, not cruel but I would be harsh and wala akong tolerance sa droga. Zero. So ‘yan ang laban natin ngayon.Kayong nagbakasyon dito from the fields in Mindanao and in the Visayas. You might want just to join the hunt for them. We will eliminate the drug lords once and for all. We have to stop this practice sa Bilibid.

Bitawan na ninyo ‘yan o kainin na ninyo ngayon ang supply ninyo. (laughs) Nawala na talaga ang pasensya ko sa inyo. Iniinsulto ninyo kami. Hinuli ko nga kayo sa Davao kasi nagluluto kayo ng shabu. Hindi ko kayo pinatay dahil magalit ang [Commission on] Human Rights. Dinala ko kayo diyan sa Muntinlupa after conviction at pagdating diyan nagluluto na naman ng shabu. Anong klase? Noon kasi ‘di ako presidente, ngayon well, we’ll just have to make some adjustment. You know there is always a time for everything. There’s always a time for you to make money and make a mockery out of our laws. There’s always a time for you to be in control even if you are inside the prison. But there is always a time to rest and to die. Ganon ang buhay. As you are born, there’s also death.

I’m not threatening you. I’m just telling you that there is always a time. For us, the security forces, the Armed forces and the police, there is always a time. We can only take so much insult. We can only take so much… hanggang kaya lang ng sikmura namin. E, ako ay nasusuka na. And you have to help me put it stop.

In the final days of the campaign at Luneta, I gave this statement and I said I will put at stake my honor, my life and the presidency.

Sinabi ko sa inyong mga kriminal, lahat kayo: If you destroy my country, I will kill you [Applause] If you destroy our children, I will kill you. If I am asked by anybody, including the Commission on Human Rights, I do not know you. [Laughter]
Salamat po.

Secretary Yasmin Busran-Lao of the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos; Atty Guiling Mamondiong, he will be the Secretary of TESDA. It is a Cabinet position. Councilor Halila Sudagar of the Davao City Council; Deputy Mayor Ismael Mike Nakan Al-Hadj; and other deputy mayors; Ali Muhammad Yusop Pasigan, the Regional Mufti of Davao Region; Director Aleem Jamal Munib of the Madrasah Schools; Laxaman Bancola, Bangon Mindanao founder; Shiekh Abdul Razzaq, Kapayapaan Peace Center founding chairman; my Muslim brothers and sisters; fellow workers in government; my beloved countrymen.

You might be surprised that there are only about three, four, or five Muslims who would be occupying a Cabinet position. Alam mo kasi, ganito ‘yan: We are trying to do a framework and if I succeed in convincing everybody in Mindanao, if I could convince my MILF brothers and Nur Misuari of the MN, there will be a reconfiguration of the territory and most of them will occupy the regional or state positions.

Mahirap na kasi na maumpisahan because I foresee that towards the end of the year, we’d be able to come up with the framework, kung paano gawin ang federalism. But, if the Filipino nation and a plebiscite would not want it, then I am ready to concede whatever is there in the BBL Law.

We will see to it that it will pass. And also, in fairness to Nur, we might also configure his territory of the Tausug nation. Then, we will have a new boundaries and these boundaries does (sic) not really intend to separate our brother Moro from the Christian. Rather, it is intended only to delineate territories. But, that should not keep us apart from being Mindanaoans. For you know, you must realize that most of the Christians here in Mindanao, your brother Christians, are supporting the federalism and the BBL.

So, tatanggapin natin sa isa’t isa. Let us build a nation that will be founded on peace and understanding. Ang tingin ko, with the grace of Allah, I might be able to do this within six years. It will not come overnight. Certainly, it will not come next year. Probably, it will be something about two to three years from now. But I assure you that something will change before I end my term.

So, ‘yung mga kapatid kong MI, a promise is a promise. Ang — my word of honor is something which I value very much. Kaya ako pag nag-bitaw ng salita ‘yun na ‘yun at hindi ko na pinapalitan.

So these are the things that we have to work in on our aspirations. I do not think that there will be another chance for the Mindanaoans to expect change kung… pag nawala ako. It might be for a long time again. Baka mahintay pa kung si Omar ‘yung anak ko maging Presidente na naman. And that is, he is devoted, devout Moro, Muslim. He goes to the… mga mosque to pray and I like it. I like religious people, especially my grand children.

Now, having said that, I’d like to, you know, talk about our problems that bedevils our country. Alam mo, nawala na talaga ang bilib ng tao sa gobyerno. I’m not saying na nandyan sa akin. It remains to be seen kung paano natin, mabigyan ng lunas ang problema.

May I ask everybody? I have the list, it includes police generals. Nandoon ‘yung mga municipal and city mayors. Meron ding nandito sa Mindanao. May mga Maranao sa listahan. May mga Bisaya, marami. May Kuratong Baleleng hanggang ngayon. Ang napagtataka ako, there’s Kuratong Baleleng sa Ozamiz. Pain in the ass ka nga sa Pilipino. Hindi na nahinto-hinto ‘yang kalokohan ng mga nag-retire na mga sundalo, sa gobyerno kung ano-anong pinapasukan — kidnapping, sa droga, sa lahat.

You know, ang panahon hindi palaging ganon. There is God who will maybe punish you one of these days. Pero sa panahon ko, hindi ako Diyos, I’m just an ordinary mortal. I’m just a follower of Allah. But, I take (inaudible) — you know I started in Catholic school but it does not — I’m not a Christian actually. I believe in God. Only Allah. Nobody else. Only one God. Alam ninyo ‘yan. Kung nakikisama lang ako, it’s because I’m a politician. You know — [laughter] Kung saan ka nandoon, kung anong simbahan ka na-timingan sa program, ‘di doon ka. [laughter] Pero, alam ng lahat na (inaudible) really disappointed also with some of the other sect. Kaya ko sila binigwasan e. Ako lang ang tao na nag-insulto ng mga bishop pati. E mga tarantado kasi. (inaudible) So ako lang ang… lahat. Pati media. Boycott, boycott daw sila, ‘di binoycott ko sila, ‘di wala na. [laughter] E, kayo e.

Pati ngayon, itong mga military generals. I am not condemning them. They deserve an investigation. But I cannot wait. My oath of office, when I say “so help me God, the Allah,” I have the sworn duty to let you know kung ano ang nangyayari sa ating bayan.

So these are the things that I have to do because I’m the President. In like manner, when I was mayor I said there are things which I have to do because nobody would do it for us, except ako — na kung ayaw ninyo, ako ang hihirit. So look at Davao. Wala namang pinatawad dito, mga Waray, mga Maranao, Ilonggo, basta dito pantay-pantay and everybody is answerable to the law.

‘Yan ang utos ni Allah. Do not do wrong to your fellowmen and you treat everybody equal. In the eyes of Allah, we are all equal. So ganoon ang nangyari and I have a still a — ang aking center piece talaga, I’m working overtime with Jun Evasco and the rest for… to constitute, ready na kami sa aming group sa gobyerno to talk to the MI, MN.

I might travel to Jolo. ‘Wag sana lang akong i-kidnap ng Abu Sayyaf. Wala naman akong perang maibigay sa kanila. Diretso putol na lang para — I have to go to Jolo to talk to Nur. And maybe I’ll order the military to just let him… just for a while for him to move around Mindanao to get a consensus amongst the followers of MN and we would be ready, simultaneous ang ating usapan sa MI.

But I said, I assure that if there is no federalism, kung ayaw talaga ng the rest of the country, well then I said what you give to the MI, must be given to MN kasi pareho lang e. I hope that we can have peace in the land. Others, marami akong plano sa ating bayan but I have to clean up. Nandyan si (inaudible) and the others. Even before the campaign, I was always stressing corruption must stop. Corruption must stop. At lahat ‘yung may ibinigay ng gobyerno para sa tao, kailangan dumating sa tao.

Now, I would like you to know that’s Cotabato’s ARMM region, has the highest incidence of hunger. So diyan ako magbuhos ng lahat, tulong, pagkain, pati ‘yung nutrition sa mga bata. Naawa ako sa mga bata. Because that is what the men on the ground, ‘yung nagsu-survey, na the highest incidence is in Mindanao. And mas profound ang hunger dito sa ating banda, including Davao. So ang ano ko muna is a national feeding program. Mabuti na lang nandito itong mga Left.

Ang gobyerno ko kasi nandyan lahat. May mga Left, komunista, may mga Right, halo-halo. Para isang usapan lang.

And this is as good as any other time, if I may just suggest to the Communist Party of the Philippines, and the media to refrain from, you know, mga ambush ambush pati patayan. Anyway, we are talking. Binigyan na nga tayo ng very good example ni Bro. Murad na in spite of the non-passage of the BBL, walang gumalaw. And Nur is also just having a stand down somewhere in Jolo.

Para ma-ano natin, hintuan na muna natin itong mga pag-kidnap kidnap ng mga sundalo. Wala naman silbi ‘yan. So that we can talk properly without the ramblings of a — paghihinakit. Kasi ‘di naman maari na ang military will just keep silent and all of their men are being kidnapped and killed and while we’re in the process of perfecting a — the wherewithals of how to proceed with the peace talks.

Alam ho ninyo, we are a nation, we are all brothers and sisters by blood. About the only time nagkagulo itong bayan natin, e kasi si (Ferdinand) Magellan pumunta dito in 1521, bringing with him Christianity. I have nothing against religion pero iniwan na sana ng gagong… religion doon sa Espanya. Bakit ba dadala-dala dito?

Kagaya ng Mindanao it was ahead by almost 100 years kasi naman – si Lapu-lapu Muslim na nga. And you know, by force of arms because there was gun powder. Wala kasi ang — Malay race tayo. Wala naman tayong mga gun powder, mga canyon and the cannons of the day. We were ignorant about that so we are just— ngayon over decades by force, naging Christians ‘yung mga Malay brothers ninyo, natin doon sa Visayas.

So those are the religion that was from down their thrones. And how — you know how the Spaniards are very cruel at that time. So let us take that as a footnote of a history to understand each other.

Buti sana kung (inaudible) sa Visayas, e mga Russian doon, o tayo dito Malaysian, patayan talaga. Kaya pwede ‘yang ganon. To the fact that before the coming of religion, we were all natives of the sultanates, somehow, datu-datu. Then because of colonialism, and that is what is happening in the Middle East.

Ayaw lang mag-(inaudible) itong Britain pati America, they force their way to Iraq and killed Saddam. Look at Iraq now. Look what happened to Libya. Look what happened to Syria. Nauubos ang tao doon, pati bata binobomba ng gasolina, because of — they were pushed to the wall for the failed promises.

Kaya sabi ko I am not including Abu Sayaff dito sa criminality, you’ve never heard me say “mga kriminal.” It is – it is a different set up there because these are the guys who were driven to desperation.

Wala na nga from Nur. Alam ko ‘yan, from Nur to the ARMM. There was no sufficient semblance of governance. And that is why they are pushed to the wall, then they became capitalized. That’s what happened in Middle East. It is not that the Middle East is exporting terrorism sa America imported terrorism, sila ‘yung —

Sinira nila ang Middle East e. Sino ba naman ‘yung si Saddam? (inaudible) but he was in firm control of the country. And now they turn out that after the investigation, he must have a (inaudible). After a thorough, almost 10 years investigation, it turn out there was no legal basis to declare war against Iraq. Kita mo ‘yan, that’s why it’s easy (inaudible).

As a nation, we must seek a venue. Bakit tayo magpatayan? Magnegosyo na lang tayo lahat. Tutal ang mga Maranao dumating na doon sa Abra. (inaudible) Anywhere, in the Philippines, basta may marinig na “DVD, DVD” ay wala na. Maranao — nandito mga Maranao, nandito.

And they were very enthusiastic, pasalamat naman ako. I love you, shukran — Magpasagasa ka lang sa sasakyan namin para lang maka- (inaudible) and the love that you have shown, the filial, brotherhood instinct — And I love you all, and may Allah give him the abundance of life there. Sila lang ‘yan nandoon, talagang ano sila, halos just to earn a living.

And it is all right for them to be anywhere or everywhere because they are Filipinos and they own this country. Lahat tayo dito, ating bayan ‘to.

So although, religion is a very sensitive issue, let us not really do something that will inflame or agitate trouble about religion. We all believe at the same God. I said Allah has blessed us with so many things. There is a temporary lull in violence in Mindanao.

Give me a chance to perfect an arrangement and I will be happy. The end of Ramadan and you’d felt great after so many nights of praying, daytime fasting, just to make us realize how important the existence of man in this —

So let us respect each other, let us talk before doing anything that would spin a violence, that is not good. Tutal nandito lang naman ako. Alam naman ninyo kung sino ako. Although my lola came from humble beginnings — so with that small of (inaudible) medyo maliit lang, manipis na bondage to you.

Let me use it as a bridge, not only between Christians and — let me use it a bridge for all to be happy in this world and to do the things that Allah wanted us to do: To do good and to believe in him and to live according to the rules of the greater man.

Maraming salamat po.

I would like to take this opportunity to make a public statement to say that we share the grief of France in the rampage of multiple murder of their citizens. We condemn the brutal and violent way that the people were run over by a truck as a terrorist act. We join the rest of the world in mourning and express our solidarity with France agains terrorism, against what is fundamentally evil.

Rest assured we join you in your fight against terrorism. Thank you.



Kindly sit down. Salamat po.

May I ask somebody to remove the prompter? Hindi ho… hindi ako nag-aano, hindi ako nagsasalita nang nagbabasa. Hindi sanay. Wala sa amin ‘yan sa probinsya.

President Ramos; Atty. Avelino Cruz; Justice Acosta; very Rev. Fr. Aloysius Maranan; the citizens of the San Beda Republic; valued guests; ladies and gentlemen.

Well, naka-tsamba tayo. Kung baga sa bisaya, ‘yung naka— sa sabong, naka-(inaudible). Well, actually, I’d like to tell you the odyssey of my presidency.

Alam mo, wala talaga akong balak maging presidente. But early on, President Ramos went to Davao and sought an audience with me, together with Paul Dominguez and Jesus Dureza. And it was there, he said that it is high time that Mindanao would have its president ever. I was giving him excuses. Alam mo naman si Presidente and he would just say: “Shut up. You listen to me.” And another offering of apology: “Sir, hindi mo talaga ako pwede diyan… Small time na mayor lang tayo.” And he would just say: “I came here to Davao to talk to you, not to talk to me. So you listen.”

So well, time passed and was a lot of movement, maliliit lang, galing sa Cebu, but mostly Visayan and a little bit of following sa Manila, Luzon. Alam mo, wala talaga akong makinarya. I would not want to belittle PDP. But it was a moribund party, until I came. Wala namang… ang —wala masyadong tao and we had to revive it. But I said going back earlier — alam mo, since the time nag-usap kami ni Presidente, up to the time when they were presenting their platforms of government — ‘yung tatlong kandidato pagka-presidente, never talked or mentioned anything about Mindanao.

Eh, sabi ko ang pinaka-problema ng Pilipinas, hindi nga itong droga e. Eh ito, 24 oras patayin mo lahat, tapos na ‘yan. Eh ang Mindanao, because it has fierce territory. And you know, the president is the president. Alam niya, kaya pumunta siya sa akin. What’s going to happen to Mindanao? There’s a war going on. There might be a lull kasi huminto tayo. We’re talking to Murad and backchanneling kami ni Presidente kay Nur Misuari. We have the number of Nur. We can get to talk to him. Pero, walang… sa tatlo na may platform about Mindanao.

Remember that Murad said: I will go to war if there is no BBL. Pakahirap ‘yan. And true enough, wala talagang BBL. But, sabi ko early on, delikado ‘to… Trying to find out kung ano bang mangyari sa Pilipinas. But still during the filing of the certificate of candidacy, I did not file anything. It was not until after I was substituted sa deadline, last day pa. Because there were really the urgings now of what will happen to the country.

Alam mo, ang mahirap kasi sa Moro, you might want to know— Ang lola ko Maranao e. But my grandfather, Chinese. Talagang galing Xiamen. Mahirap itong ano na mapahiya. Siguro pag mapahiya ito, hihirit ito. Napahiya nga, so we have to talk to him repeatedly and Jaafar na “hang on, ‘wag muna, do not try to steam a violence which you might not be able to stop on time.”

Sabi ko: Ako, kung ako manalo ng presidente, mag-patayan tayo? It’s either I shoot you or you shoot me or saan ako pupunta? Isang linya ng pamilya ko puro Moro. Kasi ‘yung mga apo ko, marami akong apo na puro Moro. Ito pa. So if there is anybody as much as interested really sa Mindanao, ako. Kaya that prompted me to reconsider and you know ’yung baraha ko. But I did not have the money. But PDP rin talaga ako, ever since. I never changed parties, ever since. PDP lang ako. Ako, pang-local lang kami because alam mo, suffering from a financial hiatus itong PDP. Walang mga backer e.

So, ‘nong tumakbo ako, I decided to run, I just prayed to God. You know guys, we have to talk. We cannot ignore the BBL and Nur Misuari.

Let me remind you that the Magellan landed in the Philippines in 1521 bringing with him Christianity, no offense intended. Katoliko ako. When he brought in the religion — Christianity — ang Islam was ahead by about mga 80 years, according to the archives ng Malaysia. Binabasa lang.

So they started to conquer the island. Naturally, they met the stiffest resistance sa Mindanao kasi may poste na doon. Nakapasok na ang Islam. And the Spaniards want to conquer the island and subjugated people there sa Christianity. ‘Yung iba, nanalo sila. But most of the Maranao, ‘yung the early fighters doon, lumaban talaga. It resulted in so many killings and massacre. ‘Yan ang naka-diperensya.

So it is historical that unless we address the historical injustice committed against the Moro people, there will never be peace in Mindanao. Ang last card diyan is pumayag na lang sila. Kung wala ng iba, federal.

That is why I ran, ang centerpiece ko talaga was federalism. ‘Yan ang hinihingi ni Misuari, parang pinaka-areglo na lang. Kung hindi pa ‘yan lulusot sa six years ko, believe me, mahirapan na kayo.

Hindi ko naman sinasabi na because may dugo akong Maranao. I could just do that anytime and I can enter Mindanao. Eh kung… through the back door or the front gate. Because I have the good will. And the, you know, the filial, feelings of the people there. ‘Yan ang — Walang kandidatong… Kaya ako natatakot, sabi ko, pagka ka pumutok ‘to, another round of violence.

Ang problema, sabi ko sa Moro: Bakit kayo magalit sa mga taong Mindanao, na ang Maynila ang gumagawa ng batas, ng BBL, pati ‘yung mga batas to enable it to be implemented? Why are you bombing the island itself? Kung gusto ninyo, ikarga natin ‘yung mga armas natin, ‘yung mga mortar na hindi pumutok ng Army, ilalagay lang… ginagawa nilang fuse eh. “Kung magtatayo ng Maynila, paputukin natin ‘yung Congress pati ‘yung Malacañang.” Bakit mo patayin ‘yung kapwa mo tao dito? Lahat naman kami may gusto e.

So, doon ang… Then the next was really, the corruption. And ang drugs. My God. ‘tong corruption in my time, during my watch, there will be no corruption, period.

Kaya yesterday, I was reading the Inquirer or isa pa, Daily Bulletin… ‘yung letters to the editor. Meron doon babae that she was given the go around, she had to kept on going back to the —

Sinabi ko sa staff: Hanapin ninyo ito. Kung anong opisina ‘to. Sabihin ninyo pinatawag ko sila dito. Kakasabi ko lang sa inaugural speech ko: You are paid to do your work. Kung gusto mo ng… hindi mo kaya ng gobyerno magbayad, e maghanap ka ng iba. Punta ka kay Ayala o kay Gokongwei. They’ll give you a better salary. But you know kung sa gobyerno pumasok ka, hanggang diyan ka lang talaga and you must know that. When you, you know, you enter into government service, you must realize na hanggang diyan ka lang and that is very important.

E, corruption. Left and right. Pati ‘yung mga bala… Why is this government oppressing its own people? Answer me that. Sabi ko: Bakit? E kung wala… Sabi ko: So it has to stop. Lahat. From the Office of the President down.

I would maybe distribute the circular. Sabi ko ‘yung Cabinet… 30 days — whatever department — 30 days, reduce the signing authority. I do not give a — kung sa anong gustong mo. Three to five signatures, one month, lalabas ‘yan. ‘Wag kayong mag-follow up. That is mandatory at magagalit talaga ako.

Now, if you cannot comply with it, then sorry. We part ways. That’s the only way to do it. Just like in Davao. You asked for a permit…Electrical, engineering or ‘yung business, three days. It’s by 72 hours. Pag hindi mo nabalik… do not release it to the guy. Sabihin ko: Ibigay mo sa akin after three days,bakit?… Tanungin kita: Bakit itong papel na ito tumagal sa—? Ganon ang mag-disiplina.

Eh kung sabihin mo na ayaw ko ng droga, umalis kayo kasi ako na ang mayor. Eh nandiyan pa rin kayo, sinabi ko na. Tapos bibili ako sa iyo ngayon. Tapos bibili uli ako sa kinabukasan. Tapos sabihin ko sa pulis, bumili ka ng pangatlo. Pagkatapos ng delivery, patayin mo.

Look, we cannot build a country by killing our own people. That is admitted. Pero, alam mo, ‘pag ka pinasukan tayo ng iba’t-ibang klaseng tribo, and from other sources outside of our country, at lulutuin mo lang ‘yung shabu diyan sa mga barko. Itatapon ninyo, lagyan ninyo ng GPS. May GPS pa ang mga ulol.

And we are the only country — I think in the world, except South America — na doon ‘yung shabu niluluto mismo sa national penitentiary. Kaya ko nga hinuli. Binuhay ko itong putang inang ‘to. Para walang masabi si — ‘yung babae diyan sige salita.

Give him a trial, a fair trial, judicial trial. O ‘di okay. O pagkatapos ano? Kasi baliktad ‘yan e. Kung taga roon ka, doon ka itatapon; kung taga-doon ka sa amin, dito ka, sa Muntinlupa ka. O, pagdating diyan, anong ginawa? Nagluto pa rin ng shabu. Eh, mas mabutang pinatay ko na lang, menos menor ‘yung problema natin.

Kaya ako galit, kasi ang shabu, constant use of shabu, even by months, would destroy the human brain. It shrinks the (inaudible). Pati ‘yung mismong utak. Actually, sabi ng forensic sa Mexico. Because they are just starting to do met, kasi mahal ‘yung heroin ngayon, mura na nga dito e. Mabuti pa ‘yung mga sa poppies, because marijuana, heroin, and cocaine, they’re grown naturally. Wala masyadong chemicals. Itong shabu, ang tubig naluluto, tubig sa baterya ng sasakyan. Parang may starter diyan sa loob ng— Kaya naging loko-loko.

Remember, I am not defending the police. Nandiyan ako sa gitna. I’m just pushing for it kasi you are putting my country in peril. Eh kakabigay ko lang ng libro kay — Ioan Grillo. It’s sold online. Bilhin ninyo. Pagkatapos ninyong mabili, basahin niyo at humarap kayo sa akin. Sabihin ko: Mali ako o tama? Four or seven years, if nobody interdicts, the drug business in the Philippines — we will be a narcopolitic. Kaya tatapusin, may magtatapos talaga nito. I have placed the burden upon myself. Tatapusin ko ito even at the cost of my honor, my life, and the presidency.

Kaya I have repeatedly stressed na hindi ako mamatay kung hindi ako ma-presidente. Anyway,nagkaroon kami ng ruckus sa media, boycottin niyo ako. Look, kayo, ayaw ninyo mag-boycott sa akin? Pag hindi niyo boycott sa akin, ako mag-boycott sa inyo. Wala akong…

I can let go of this presidency any time. ‘Wag mo lang akong ganunin. Do not. Kasi hindi ako sanay nang ganon e. ‘Yung basta bastusin ka na lang. Imagine being asked publicly: “How is your health?” “I’m fine.” “So, where is your medical report?”

Mabuti nandyan ang media, kung wala… bastusin ka ng… O ‘di bastusin ko rin kayo. Wala akong… Hindi tayo magkaintindihan dito. For the things that I order the police and the military to do it, I am the one ultimately, legally responsible for it. Ako, ‘wag sila.

‘Wag mo idemanda ang pulis. Walang mangyari diyan. (inaudible) Naghanap ako sa Constitution, kasi San Beda tayo e. Siyempre… Paano itong — a raid against us? Nakita mo naman dito, mas in love sila, I don’t have to mention it. ‘Yung due process, due process. Anong due process? Due process ulol. Kung nasa korte ka na… not given by the President, due process. Hindi ako korte. Why should I give you due process? I can give you a lawyer. I cannot handle a proceeding or proceedings against you.

Tawagin ko kayo sa Malacañang. Murahin ko kayo doon. Tapos barilin ko kayo. ‘Wag… Due process. Due process. Hingiin mo ‘yan sa korte. And during the time, when you are in custody, being investigatedmaybe, but ako ang trabaho ko is I have this sworn, the sacred duty to tell the Filipino the state of things in this country and simply the truth, period.

Kaya lang— sinabi diyan: “Rodrigo Duterte, after naming several generals, who’d give them due process?” Nagkaroon ba ako? Maiksi yun ano mo… Sinabi ko na noon, wala pang kampanya: You might want to retire early. You guys who know that I know na ganon tayo. ‘Di yan pang— Anong due process? Lahat ng kolumnista lahat kayo marunong eh kasi hindi ka taga-San Beda e.

Well, the two events in my life that made me simply proud: One is that I graduated from San Beda College, and the other one was the greatest compliment that I received to make me towards the presidency.

One day, Mendiola was really very dangerous at that time. The militant, ‘yung mga estudyante, and the left, ‘wag na natin mag-bolahan, sila ‘yan e. Mga komunista. Kung baga, bakbakan diyan sa ano.

So kami doon sa loob, sa eskwelahan, nagsi-uwian na ‘yung high school. Then, sabi ko: Siguro uwian na tayo nito. Nag-uwi na lahat. Kumain muna tayo sandali. Kasi baka ma-trapik. Kung ma-trapik tayo nito, patay. So kain kami ‘nong, ‘yung sa barbecue-han. Tapos, I do not remember. I think it was [Cablitas?] was one of them. Palabas kami, so we were in the pedestrian platform, dumating si Justice Solidum. Pagpasok niya, nasa front seat lang ‘yun nagda-drive, sabi ko sa kanya, ‘yung Volkswagen niya garag-garag. Sabi niya, kilala niya kami: “Where are you going?”

Sabi ko: “Sir, it’s dangerous outside.” Sabi niya, “Never mind. You go back.” Wala na masyadong estudyante. Siguro naabot doon ‘yung nagdadaldal na hindi pa umuwi kaagad. So pumunta kami doon.May tinanong siya. (inaudible) Parang may narinig ako, ‘di tumindig ako. Sabi ko: Sir, ang — Matanda na rin ako. 71 years old. Tapos sabi niya sa akin, dalawa kami. “Why are you standing?” “I thought, sir, that I heard my name called.” “Ah, because you’re always talking at the back.” (inaudible) Pagdating ko doon sabi niya: (inaudible) “Sit down. You recite.” Tindig ako. Tapos tiningnan kami. “So what?” “Sir, there is no question yet, sir.”

“Duterte, do not, Duterte, do not scratch your… you’re in the classroom and spread your dandruff. Keep it on your hand. Because it’s the only one you have”.

So you might want to say that, the “dandruff President”. Tama kasi sabi ko… Mayabang ako. Nagalit lalo… Eh ‘di nagkagulo. “Duterte, do not scratch. Do not spread your dandruff in this room. Keep it on your head it’s the only one you’ve got.”

Well, that made me a lawyer. Actually, kaming sa batch namin, hindi naman tayo nang-ano sa iba, we are all, tayo- tayo lang naman.

Sa (inaudible) succession pati remedial law, talagang matataas, dumaan rin kay Justice, kay Secretary Puno and the others, our professors. Si Rudy naman, Robles, at that time, sir, he just topped the bar at the time, kami ‘yung buena mano.

By the way, I was in Bohol campaigning for the presidency. I passed by Vic’s house. Victor de la Serna. Minsan nagkita kami doon sa Bohol. Nandiyan si Boy Brillantes. Pero ‘yung nagbalik ako, medyo, matanda na si… Pero sabi niya na pagkatapos ng meeting, dumaan ka. So hindi na ako nakadaan so pinadala niya.

“Sir, this is my little help for you. This is really hard earned money.” Tinago ko ‘yun, pati ‘yung pera. Hindi ko ginastos. Hindi ko naman alam. Hanggang ngayon nandoon sa envelope. Nilagyan ko lang ng rubber band. “Do something good for your country and if you find it hard because there are many ‘yung ayaw, then if it is good, do it, declare Martial Law.” Pakita ko sa inyo. You guys, if you go to Davao, it’s in my safe. Ipapakita ko talaga sa inyo. Tawagan ninyo si Vic. “If you find it hard to do it because of… then declare Martial Law.”

Well, I will not do it. Far from it actually. We were there around during those times. Ang akin lang is ‘yung… let the Filipino taste what is government. So kaya ‘yung ano, the usual is if they go there… Plano ko kasi bigyan mo ng shopping list. I mean the requirements for that particular whatever then ‘wag mo nang dagdagan, ‘wag mong kunan. If he produces all those documents, bigay niya sa’yo, you have to have a journal. Receive the following application for whatever. You sign it. Do not do it in the… kasi ma-erase sa… And let him sign also. Bigyan mo ng stub then go to the computer. Ang laki ng gastos. Tapos ‘di nagagamit. Then look at the workload. Then you say come back on this day, next month on this day at this hour. Bigyan mo ng stub. Pagbigay niya, kailangan nandyan na ‘yan.

I do not want to see the Filipino queuing outside. Ayoko ‘yan. Specially ‘yung mahirap. It might be a pretended sentiment, whatever you call it to do the unbeliever, basta ayaw ko, lalo na ‘yung mga taga-probinsya. Lalo na ‘yung taga-probinsya na magastos pag pupunta rito tapos maubos na ang sweldo kababalik. You know it’s always one trip dito e.

If you go down sa NAIA, you ask for a lodging there somewhere, makikitira. Tapos, pupunta doon, isang biyahe lang sa kalayo. Tapos, pabalik-balikin mo ng araw, kalokohan na ‘yan, something has got to be there.

Kaya sabi ko kay Bebot Bello: “Find a space there”. Lagyan mo ng kung saan ‘yung opisina mo, gusto mong lumipat nang malaki, find a space there where you can place the satellites of, sa DFA, tapos sa National Bureau of Investigation, diyan na, one stop, same building. At least same vicinity. Malalakad siguro one hundred meters. Then that’s it. Ayokong magbalik-balik ang tao. I would like to stress it again. Ayaw ko pahirapan ang Pilipino, period. Ayaw ko.

So mandatory ‘yan, including the Office of the President down to the barangay level. I will bind the local governments to strictly end it here… to what the essence of government service. Diyan tayo. diyan tayo. Mag-tiis lang kayo kasi sabagay six years lang naman ‘to. Pero pag ka nagka-diperensya tayo dito, umatras ka… kasi talagang ayaw ko.

Davao is what Davao is today. Sinabi ko, here are the rules. Umalis kayo. I would not pursue you beyond the boundaries of my city. Go out. Tapos kayong taga-gobyerno, ganito. If you cannot do it, tell me and I will give you your marching orders out. Pati police. I have the most behaved police force in the entire Philippines in Davao. I do not allow checkpoints.

Kaya dito ngayon, I will, one of these days, depending also on the advice of the military and the police. I would… Tanggalin ko lahat ng checkpoints. Ngayon, sa bukid sino ang mag-checkpoint? Eh ‘di ‘yung mga NPA. Anong trabaho ninyo? Nagdadala kayo ng armas, wala naman kayong… Eh nag-uusap tayo ‘di ba? O, eh ‘di slowdown muna kayo.

I will be asking the NDF to just really do that. Lahat… mabuti na lang goodwill ng MI and the rest of Mindanao, the Moro leaders are up against arms also against the drug mule. And it’s good for our country. It’s good for us. Just like China… War, it is not an option. So what did the others say? Peaceful talks. I cannot give you the wherewithal now. I have to consult many people, including President Ramos. He might also want to be one of the… but I would like to respectfully ask him to go to China and start the back talk. Ibigay natin. But we do not also want to offend the United States. Why? Because we have identified ourselves allied with the Western powers. So there’s an interest which we should not forget: Our interest and the interest of our allies.

Now there are a lot of complications there. Because now that the Tribunal has ruled, ‘yung arbitral decision states that… And if China would insist on a space domain, that you have to identify yourselfbefore you can cross that vast sea there, America will not like it. Although they insist it’s the Philippine air space and, of course, the maritime security, it’s just too narrow there. Alam mo ‘pag nagsara ‘yan, lahat tataas because even the insurance of the cargoes and the boats, and the ships there, tataas. So you do create another problem for our economy and somebody else’s finances. So careful tayo diyan. So we have to navigate with courtesy. Hindi naman ito nadadala ng… Puro lang ito istorya talaga, your honor, your excellency, sige bow, bow.

Dito na ako sa trabaho na ito. Even here. Siguro, you get a lot of whispers. Nakita mo, left and right ‘yan. Ako piskal ako, mag-bulong-bulungan sa akin diyan. But now you get a lot of whispers, including sa labas or state matter but I assure you that the run of this country would be like just what we are in our hearts. The San Beda faithfulness to our nation.

So.. gambling has to stop, but in the meantime that I am focused on the drug menace. Why? Because kapag ka tinanggal mo ‘yan, there is that apparatus of gambling. Iyong mga kumukolekta ng pusta and you suddenly mabakante ‘yan, everybody stops. Ang magte-take over ng organization ‘yan, pakilaman na ‘yan ng droga. See? Doesn’t mean to say that I like jueteng. Maa-ano tayo…I cannot (inaudible) So I called the military. Hindi naman lahat e. Just a thing there to help the police. But they have to undergo so many legal lectures about the law on arrest and seizure. Then the delivery of persons to the judicial authority, the number of hours; how to get a warrant for an arrest or to search a building. Marami. Even in the handling of ‘yung drug cases. (inaudible) But I remember at the time when I was a prosecutor, very early on sa 1970’s. It was really a heartbreaking job. Alam mo, may kaso ka it’s good, the affidavits are there. But pag-present ng evidence, some wise say that “we want to have an analysis of the… because your honor we’ve heard the stories that…” At totoo nga. Hawak-hawak ko. Sabi ko: In my time, do not do it to me. Huwag sa akin, sa iba na lang. Sa iba na lang. Huwag sa akin kasi medyo mapapasubo tayo nito na…

Well, anyway, I cannot detain you for a longer time. If there’s anything that you’d like me to answer, let us convert this thing into an open forum if you like. Okay ako. Pero basta ako iwas lang kayo diyan sa mga… Tsaka ‘yung mga abugado na gusto…There are a lot…Ako abugado ako…Litigation, I mean sa courtroom. Huwag naman ‘yang mga drug lord. Susmaryosep. Maraming kaso diyan na pakialam mo… Ibigay mo doon sa iba. Ibigay mo doon sa taga-U.P pati Ateneo. Baka madali ka pa. Kasi ang alam ko nagturo drug lord din e. Hindi abugado ‘yun gago. Papuntahin mo sila sa korte. Bigay mo na sa iba. Marami diyan. Huwag lang San Beda kasi, mga kaibigan ko sa Davao noong mayor ako, iwas kaso sila.Mas (inaudible) iyong lawyer there. Ayaw nila kasi alam nila ayaw ko e. So ‘yung mga abugado nila, sa labas. Nothing significant but that was the practice. ‘Yung mga seduction, mga abduction with consent, sakit talaga ng Bedista ‘yan. Okay ‘yan. Adultery, okay ‘yan. Concubinage. Yours truly, meron din eh. Hindi naman tayo mabubuhay diyan kung ano… That’s why during the inauguration, two sets of pamilya. ‘Di okay lang. First in history, first from Mindanao; first president to have two families present there. Ayaw mo ba ‘yan? That is in keeping obedience of the torture that is there but has never accepted by anybody, but everybody is doing it.

Well, anyway I’d like to thank you for this moment with you. And if there’s anything that I can do for you. If it’s legal, if it’s right, no problem. Wala akong problema… Kung wala kang — Siguro ‘yung iba matanda na, walang trabaho, e ‘di sabihin mo sa akin. Maraming… There are thousands actually, it’s 1,600. ‘Di ba nga sabi ko, hayaan mo na, kung wala lang naman ano diyan, walang, no corruption nothing. Huwag mo nang istorbohin ‘yung nandyan na sa pwesto. Hayaan mo, okay na ‘yan sa akin. Ako basta, it’s competence and integrity, honesty, ‘pag andiyan ka, we can work together. You can go to me anytime. Ang problema, pero nakakatawa nito, ‘wag kayong mag-maong. Totoo ‘yan. Tama naman ‘yan. Hindi ka papasukin. You are there kapag naka-maong kasi medyo… Bawal ang maong. Bawal ito.

So ngayon punta ako ‘nong… alam ko ‘yan. Pero ‘yung kasi ‘yung panahon ni Estrada there was this incident that my son, the vice mayor now Davao City, got into trouble with a security guard. Pinalo niya ‘yung gate, nabali ‘yung kamay ng security guard. Tapos, alam mo na, the media, as the media want to do. So interview na: “Paano mag-demanda ka?”

Sabi ng security guard, “hindi ako magdemanda kasi ang tatay congressman.” So itong media tawagkaagad: “What can you say about the statement of the security guard?” Iyong nasaktan ayaw din niyang magdemanda. Sabi ko: “Madali ‘yan”. So right there and then, I tendered my resignation for Congress. It’s on record. I am the only Congressman nag-tender ng resignation. Sabi ko: Because of the incident involving my son, tapos ganon blah blah blah. Then I submitted it to Villar. Sabi ni Villar… He said: “You know the agenda, the resignation of Duterte?” Sabi naman ni Joker, the late Joker Arroyo: “No, we are not allowed to aspect any resignation from any. We are not the employer of Duterte. We are not from his district. It is only the people of his district who can accept his resignation.”

Ako for (inaudible) the reason of delicadeza, nag-resign na talaga ako. Sabi ko: “Alam mo, there will so be many elections in the future”. ‘Pag buhayin ako ng Panginoong Diyos. We’re talking about God. I will end my talk here. Do you know and you review the tapes, do you know that I was the only one, the only candidate who invoked, who was invoking the name of God during the campaign? Alam ba ninyo ‘yun? You review the tapes. Wala kang marinig ni isa mag-sabi. Ako every time: If the grace of God, God wills it. Babalik-balik ‘yan. And the ultimate statement was I made sa Luneta during the miting de avance. I said that: “If God wants me to be president, I will be president of this country. If God does not want me president, he will give me the sign or maybe defeat,” sabi ko.

And alam ko, maraming papasok sa atin sa pulitika, ako dead end na ako. I was elected in mayor in Davao in 1988. I coasted along for 23 years as mayor of Davao City; one term congressman; one term vice mayor ni Inday, ‘yung anak ko, taga-San Beda din ‘yun. ‘Yung nambugbog ng pulis, nandito ‘yunparent. Isa rin ‘yun. Alam ninyo — except for Marcos, si Imee, and si Abet, Governor Abet sa Bataan —Alam mo ba even sa Mindanao, outside, wala akong mayor or governor. Even sa Mindanao. Wala akong ni isang barangay captain sa Luzon, Bicol, or Visayas.

Kaya nga I was so perplexed also after the result because during the campaign na-mesmerize ka sa mga crowd e. So you think that you are already formidable, tapos ‘yung sa ano… Hindi ko talaga malaman paano ako nanalo. Wala akong ni isang barangay captain dito sa Calabarzon pati Metro Manila wala. Except of course ‘yung mga taga-San Beda. Napakarami na pala natin, akala ko ba bago lang ‘tong San Beda. Biro mo, lahat ng taga-San Beda bumoto e ‘di ’yun lang ang nagpanalo sa akin. Kagaya ni (inaudible), after ni President Ramos siya ang una kong pinuntahan kasi Bedista e… Tapos pagsabing “okay.” “Saan ka?” Nandiyan ‘yan. I offered him something, ayaw e, sa Cabinet. I offered him a Cabinet post. Lahat naman ito sila, puro magagaling. Kasi irregular ako e. Nadisgrasya ako sa kotse. I am hard hearing sa right ear, may fracture ako dito. Pero, Pero magagaling, Vit Aguirre, cum laude; Art Tugade; si Bingbong Medialdea, marami ‘to San Beda. Marami sila. Sabi ko… Rudy Salalima.

Sabi nila, ito si Duterte walang kilala kung hindi San Beda o taga-Davao. Is that a riddle? I’ll give you the answer. Probinsyano ako. Nag-aral ako ng Maynila. Along the way, wala naman akong nakilala na talagang naging… except my wife kasi stewardess e. Itong asawa ko, German, si Zimmerman. Maganda ‘yon. Pero ang kilala ko, taga Davao, far and wide in between the years — ang sabi sa akin: “Sino naman ang kilala ko?” “Well, except your wife…sa Maynila?” Dito naman sa dormitoryo lang ng YMCA, pati sa eskwelahan. So sino naman ang makilala ko na brilliant? Except si Sal because talagang outstanding, Sal Panelo, UP.

Wala akong ibang kilala na bright. I was not invented to the social. They didn’t even recognize me, my name. Wala, except sa eskwelahan. So ang nakuha ko ‘yung kilala ko na mga bright. Carlos Dominguez, the Finance. Kababata ko ‘yun since Kindergarten. Valedictorian ‘yan hanggang natapos ‘yan sa… I don’t know what school sa Amerika. So puro ang kilala ko — ang kilala ko lang na may…Si PAGCOR, si Andrea , she campaigned for me. ‘Yun talagang… So ‘yun lang ang kilala ko sa buhay ko, e ‘di sila ‘yung kinuha ko, ‘yung mga… Kasi wala naman ibang nag-apply, sige ako hanap.

Iyan ang sikreto doon. Kasi wala akong kakilala. Ang kilala ko lang na mga bright. Puro mga… Vit Aguirre; Tugade, bright boy ‘yan. Sonny Dominguez, valedictorian. Puro valedictorian. Ang presidente, 75 lang. Okay lang naman. Jess Dureza. Naging classmate ko ‘yan, valedictorian.

Nakita ko nga ‘yung grado niyan, general weighted average, pag-graduate namin, sabay kami kumuha ng card e. Sabi ko, pagtingin ko sa kanya: “Jess ilan ‘yung iyo?” Sabi niya: “96, bay” ‘Yung iyo?” Kuhako naman. Sabi ko: “Wala, wala. Kukunin ko pa.” Tapos paglabas, 78.

By the way, Jess Dureza is working for me ha, so is Sonny Dominguez, Art Tugade and Vit. All brilliant working for ordinaryong Bedista lang.

Salamat po.

Thank you. Please allow me a little bit of informality at the outset. You would realize that the three guys in the elevated portion of Congress are from Mindanao. So, wala na talaga kaming masabi. Senate President Aquilino Pimentel III, Members of the Senate, Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez and the Members of the House of Representatives, Vice President Maria Leonor Robredo, President Fidel Valdez Ramos, President Joseph Ejercito Estrada, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno and the Justices of Supreme Court, His Excellency Papal Nuncio and members of the diplomatic corps. Well of course, I have also to greet the Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea, the members of the Cabinet, fellow workers in government, my countrymen.

We cannot move forward if we allow the past to pull us back. Finger-pointing is not the way. That is why I will not waste precious time dwelling on the sins of the past or blaming those who are perceived to be responsible for the mess that we are in and suffering from.

Except maybe to extract a lesson or two from its errors, we will not tarry because it is the present that we are concerned with and the future that we should be prepared for.

Lest I be misunderstood, let me say clearly, that those who betrayed the people’s trust shall not go unpunished and they will have their day in Court. And if the evidence warrants, they will have their day of reckoning too.

When I decided to seek the presidency of this republic, I knew what the ills of our country were; I knew their causes; and I was briefed on those who caused the causes.

I heard the people on the streets complain that justice had become illusory; that equity and fairness and speedy disposition of cases had deteriorated into hollow concepts fit only for masteral dissertations. It was, and still is, very sad indeed.

As a former prosecutor, I know that there are ways of knowing how fast or how slow cases go. What I did was to look into the number of postponements and the time difference between each postponement and the next setting. It was simple as that. I will appreciate deeply if we all in government attend to this urgent need.

I was determined then as I am now determined and better now positioned, to wage war against those who make a mockery of our laws including those who make life for us all miserable.

I wish to assure everyone though that vindictiveness is not in my system. Just like you and I, all equal treatment and equal protection are what I ask for our people.

But we must have the courage to fight for what we believe in, undeterred by the fear of failing or losing. Indeed, courage knows no limits, cowardice does.

At this point, there are concerns few I wish to convey to all to the end that as I perorate on facts, figures, plans, programs, and solutions, these concerns will not dissipate or get lost along our way.

Thus to our religious, bishops, leaders, priests, pastors, preachers, imams let me assure you that while I am a stickler for the principle of separation between Church and State, I believe quite strongly that there should never be a separation between God and State.

During my inauguration last (June) 30, 2016, I said that the fight against criminality and illegal drugs and corruption will be relentless and sustained.

I reiterate that commitment today, and that is why I call on the Philippine National Police, the barangay chairmen, the Mayors, the Governors and all those occupying seats of power and authority, not to lower their guard. There will be no let-up in this campaign. Double your efforts. Triple them, if need be. We will not stop until the last drug lord, the last financier, and the last pusher have surrendered or put behind bars or below the ground, if they so wish.

To our police officers and other officials, do your job and you will have the unwavering support of the Office of the President. I will be with you all the way. Abuse your authority, and there will be a hell to pay, for you will have become worse than criminality itself.

I order the National Police Commission (NAPOLCOM) to hasten the conduct of investigation and adjudication of administrative cases against police officers involved in criminal activities and illegal activities and prescribe policies on lifestyle checks for PNP members. In this quest, I will put at stake my honor, my life, and the presidency itself.

The DILG is also directed to strictly monitor how LGUs perform their supervision functions over the police and those found not performing will be sanctioned including the loss of police deputation from the NAPOLCOM. Let me repeat my warning to all. I repeat my repeat, my repeat to all, do not do drugs because you will be the solution to the drug crisis that has engulfed, “malawak” the nation.

We will create an Inter-Agency Committee on Illegal Drugs that will integrate efforts and strengthen the partnership of all stakeholders.

The reservists will be mobilized for information campaign against drug use and the dissemination of information regarding drug rehabilitation programs being offered by the government. Let us also strengthen our ROTC Program to instill love of country and good citizenship.

We will also prioritize the rehabilitation of drug users. We will increase the number of residential treatment and rehabilitation facilities in all regions of the country. The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) will facilitate the preparations for the use of military camps and facilities for drug rehabilitation.

There can never be real, tangible and felt development without making our people feel secure. And it is our duty to uplift the people’s welfare.

With this, my administration shall be sensitive to the State’s obligations to promote and protect, and fulfil the rights of our citizens, especially the poor, the marginalized and the vulnerable and

social justice shall be pursued, even as the rule of law shall at all times prevail.

My administration shall implement a human approach to development and governance, as we improve our people’s welfare in the areas of health, education, adequate food and housing, environmental preservation, and respect for culture.

Human rights must work to uplift human dignity. But human rights cannot be used as a shield or an excuse to destroy the country—your country and my country.

Meantime, since our country continues to be confronted with internal security threats aggravated by the existence and activities of the terrorist group Abu Sayyaf Group, the full force of the AFP will be applied to crush these criminals who operate under the guise of religious fervor. The AFP shall enhance its capability to search and engage these rogue and lawless elements.

We have to strengthen our coordination with Indonesia and Malaysia to suppress the kidnapping in the waters of our neighboring countries. We will strengthen our counter-terrorism programs by amending various laws on human terrorism, terrorism financing and cybercrime.

This is our answer to the challenges of the global developments on the non-traditional threats, transnational crimes and fanatical terrorism. Addressing global warming shall also be our top priority, but upon a fair and equitable equation. It must not stymie our industrialization.

We must also endeavor to develop and cultivate partnerships with nations sharing common interests and concerns with the Philippines; maintain and sustain bilateral and multilateral consultations and dialogues.

We will continue to expand cooperation on human assistance and disaster response, maritime security and counter terrorism. We shall deepen security dialogues with other nations to build greater understanding and cooperation.

With regard to the West Philippine Sea, otherwise known as China Sea, we strongly affirm and respect the outcome of the case before the Permanent Court of Arbitration as an important contribution to the ongoing efforts to pursue a peaceful resolution and management of our disputes.

On the aspect of our peace processes relating to our engagement with the international community, the Philippines shall remain committed to continue thorough working with our international partners achieving lasting peace and progress in the country.

We will vigorously address the grievances that have been time and again expressed, not only by the Bangsamoro, indigenous peoples and other groups for security, development, fair access to decision- making and acceptance of identities.

Enduring peace can only be attained only if we meet these fundamental needs of every man, woman and child.

To our Muslim brothers, the Moro country and the members of the CPP/NPA/NDF, let me say this:

All of us want peace, not the peace of the dead, but the peace of the living. We express our

willingness and readiness to go to the negotiating table, and yet we load our guns, fix our sights, pull the trigger. It is both ironic and tragic— and it is endless. While we extol the bravery and heroism of our soldiers, kayo, the rebels, do the same for your members and fighters. What I see instead are the widows and the orphans and I feel their pain and grieve, and no amount of cash assistance or the number of medals can compensate the loss of a human life. Sorrow cuts across every stratum of society. It cuts deeply and the pain lasts forever.

That is why I reach out to all of you today. To our Muslim brothers, let us find, let us end the centuries of mistrust and warfare. To the CPP/NPA/NDF, let us end these decades of ambuscades and skirmishes. We are going nowhere, and it is getting bloodier by the day.

To immediately stop violence on the ground, restore peace in the communities and provide an enabling environment conducive to the resumption of the peace talks. I am now announcing a unilateral ceasefire with the CPP/NPA/NDF effective immediately, and call on our Filipinos in the National Democratic Front and its forces to respond accordingly.

Let me make this appeal to you: “If we cannot, as yet, love one another, then in God’s name, let us not hate each other too much,” so it was said. I say the same to you today.

We will strive to have a permanent and lasting peace before my term ends. That is my goal. That is my dream.

On the macroeconomic management, my administration will continue and maintain current macroeconomic policies, and even do better.

We will achieve this through prudent fiscal and monetary policies that can help translate high growth into more and better job creation and poverty reduction. By the end of my term, I hope and pray to hand over an economy that is much stronger, characterized by solid growth, low and stable inflation, dollar reserves, and robust fiscal position.

On taxation, my administration will pursue tax reforms towards a simpler and more equitable and more efficient tax system that can foster investment and job creation. We will lower personal and corporate income tax rates and relax the Bank Secrecy Law. Eh nag-Presidente ako. Ayaw ko sanang makialam dito, sa mga ito. Alam mo na. Well anyway, may I continue.

At the household level, there must be sufficient income for all Filipinos to meet the basic food and non- food needs of their families. We shall continue to attract investments that will generate thousands of jobs each year — jobs that are suitable for the poor and less skilled members of the workforce.

Reforms to ensure competitiveness and promote ease of doing business will be mandatory.

Relaxing restrictions on the economy will be needed to make more investments to come and to develop labor-intensive industries such as manufacturing, agriculture and tourism shall be pursued.

We must also invest in human capital and ensure equal access to economic opportunities.

The implementation of the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Law must be put into full force and effect so that couples, especially the poor, would have freedom of informed choice on the number and spacing of children they can adequately care and provide for,

eventually making them more productive members of the labor force.

When employment is not an option, for instance in extremely rural neighborhoods, entrepreneurship will be advocated.

We shall also enhance local business environment by addressing bottlenecks in business registration and processing, streamlining investment application process and integration of the services of various government offices.

Government Financial Institutions (GFIs) shall come up with out-of-the box financing packages to capacitate our small and medium entrepreneurs.

In the field of tourism, we shall construct more access roads and tourism gateways to service centers and tourist sites.

Road development projects shall complement with the thrust to provide modern agriculture infrastructure, expanding and improving the construction and rehabilitation of road and the irrigation and establishing modern harvest and post-harvest facilities to minimize losses.

We shall also conduct a nationwide soil analysis to determine areas most suitable for rice farming to optimize production with the use of effective soil rehabilitation and fertilization.

We shall strictly enforce fisheries laws, particularly on illegal fishing and promote aquaculture along river banks and in backyards.

On the other hand, we will accelerate infrastructure spending by improving national roads and bridges and implementing the Mindanao Logistics Infrastructure Network and other road network master plans. We shall pursue inter-island linkage projects.

We shall be implementing structural mitigation to address the perennial flooding in Metro Manila and neighboring areas. We shall put up new pumping stations in strategic places.

The revival of the operation of the Pasig River Ferry Service System is a viable option for the severe traffic congestion in Metro Manila. This serves as an alternative mode of transportation for passengers particularly those coming from the east side of Metro to reach specific destinations within the cities of Manila, Mandaluyong, Pasig, Taguig, Marikina and Quezon City.

Our anti-colorum campaign and out-of-line apprehension, including the removal of terminals will be intensified. And my God, it will be done immediately, immediately.

To address lack of road infrastructure in Metro Manila, usage of existing roads will be maximized. Thus, there is a need to cooperate and coordinate with LGUs to map out secondary routes and to consult with various stakeholders, including the public transport operators.

Many in government realistically opine, that I would have to agree, that the worsening traffic situation could be logically addressed, if Congress would also accord emergency powers to the agencies concerned.

Ayaw mo? Okay lang din. Pakita namin kung gusto ninyong madalian. Alam naman talaga ninyo sagad na lahat. Sagad na. Nasa inyo iyan. If you give it, fine. If you don’t give, we’ll take the longer route, slowly. And tanggapin ko iyong pagmumura ninyo, huwag lang sa malapit. Eh

ganoon talaga eh… it’s an urgent and immediate situation, solution. Gusto ninyo madali, okay. ‘Pag ayaw naman ninyo, because baka sabihin ninyo graft and corruption naman, ‘di okay rin.

I assure — wala ito sa script… I assure you, this will be a clean government. If that is the only worry that you have, and I can understand your misgiving.

Wala na ito sa… haba… wala na ito sa script. You know, ako makagarantiya, 101% it will be clean. Problem is I can only act through agencies and departments. That’s why I urge you na maski konting mali lang, wala akong ano doon… wala na akong politika, wala na. I’m through, after this. I just pass on to you the information that, you know, I act through Secretary and everything, I cannot guarantee their honesty and competence at all times. Cabinet members, yes. Pero iyong sa baba — procurement, iyong mag bidding diyan… but as far as I can relate… really malinis talaga ito.

Napag-usapan namin sa likod about the federal system.

You know, my advice to you is: maintain a federal system, a parliament, but be sure to have a President. Huwag, hindi na ako niyan, I’m disqualified and by that time I would no longer be here. But I can commit today, to the Republic of the Philippines and its people, if you hurry up the federal system of government and you can submit it to the Filipino people by the fourth, fifth year — kasi proseso ‘yan eh. You call for a referendum and after that call a presidential election, I will go. Sibat na ako. But you must have a president. You copy the France system. Huwag mong hayaan ‘yang puro na parliament, delikado yan. It takes time even for the—iyong kagaya ng England ‘no, because of this bomb on the double deck, took them time really because there is no one apparatus for the Commander-In-Chief down. You cannot be president, you can elect. Maybe Tito Sotto will be a lucky guy at the time. Oh ‘di, limitahan mo lang. Ceremonial powers, power to dissolve, power to offset the resolution or whatever. Mandating you this, do that… or ceremonial powers, except in times of need. If there’s a demand for action, you must have a president. Wala na ako niyon. I said if you can give me that document, I will urge you to conduct, to order a… call for an election the following day, following week. And even if there’s still two years, three years, I will go. Okay na ako. Do not worry about me. I am into… too that’s much ambitious. Eh nanalo pa eh. Hindi ko nga alam kung bakit ngayon, noon nandoon lang ako oh. Totoo man. Sino ba nagsuporta sa akin dito? Wala man. Not a single congressman, except for two provinces, governor. Iyon lang. Wala akong barangay captain, wala akong… wala lahat. Pero ngayon… [Applause]

Processing time in issuing permits and licenses shall be reduced to the barest minimum. In my city, it is always three days for local government. That will bind the Office of the President down to the last barangay. Three days, three days, local government. Business permit, clearances— hindi, teka lang. No follow up. Bigyan mo ng stub, be back next week, tignan mo iyong work load and I will require every department, iyong dito sa itaas, they must have a logbook. Huwag sa computer, okay, itong ganito na-i- erase ‘yan. Ilagay mo day, time, I accept the document of Rodrigo Duterte, then go to your computer. You must have an actuarial projection there. Look at the work load, napakabobo mo naman… oh ilan ang work load ninyo, tapos pag bumalik ka dito August 3, 3:00 o’clock, ibigay mo, ibigay mo.

Ngayon I will be establishing 8888 only for, dedicated to corruption. Pag may marinig ako sa Executive Department, even a whisper, even a whisper, hiwalay-hiwalay na tayo. Marami diyan sa, diyan sa gallery, marami diyan walang trabaho, nag-a-apply hanggang ngayon. Hindi naman lahat kasi mayayaman iyan eh, mga asawa ninyo ata iyan.

While the issuance and distribution of motor vehicle plates at point of sale or through motor vehicle dealers shall be considered. Wag na sa LTO kasi hanggang ngayon, panahon pa ni Hesukristo iyong first plate nila hanggang ngayon wala pa. Bayad na iyon, until now sa awa ng Diyos.

For the driver’s licenses, its effectiveness will be extended from the current 3-year period to 5 years.

To reduce queuing time at ticketing stations, tickets sa mga train will be made readily available and easily accessible to the riding public kung bilhin mo iyan sa malls, stalls and stores, ipinagbibili mo iyon sa… di diyan mo na ibigay, accredited. Wag doon banda sa Recto kasi sigurado pekein iyan ng mga ulol.

May I address again to the Filipino. Ako po ay doble ang pagod para sa inyo, para sa kapakanan ng bayan. Seryoso po ako. Kayong mga ganoon, tiket-tiket at magkaroon ng gulo, huwag ho ninyong gawain iyan. Ito na iyong warning ko, yun ang last. Wala ng iba, hindi ko na gagawin uli. Wag ninyong sirain iyong mga bagay-bagay na ginagawa namin para sa kapakanan ng tao. Mabuti iyang magkaintindihan tayo. Kaya wag ninyong gawin. Simple lang iyan eh. Para walang away sa gobyerno ‘yung mga bagay na illegal at masama at hindi tama, wag mong gawin at hindi kami mag-aaway dito. Pati iyong pari, pati si Pope tinamaan.

Let us be clear with each other, I am for the comfort and the welfare of the Filipinos. Kayo namang hindi pa bungog dyan, hindi pa pumasok iyang mga droga, kung ayaw ninyong mamatay, ayaw ninyong masaktan, wag kayong umasa diyan sa mga pari, pati human rights, hindi nakakapigil ‘yan ng kamatayan. So, wag ninyong gawin. Eh tapos nandiyan ka nakabulagta and you are portrayed in a broadsheet na parang Mother Mary cradling the dead cadaver of Jesus Christ.

Ayan ang mga yan eh. Magdadramahan pa tayo dito. Dito ako nakatingin kasi nandito iyong public eh. Alam mo ilang beses ko nang sinasabi yan, kunyari sa Davao, huwag mong gawin kasi magkakaproblema tayo.

He who is the cause of the cause is the cause of them all. Ikaw iyong nag-umpisa, you swallow—ulitin ko ha, he who is the cause of the cause is the cause of them all. Kami nagtatrabaho lang. We have a nation to guard. We have millions of people to see that they are healthy. It’s a question of drugs, it’s a question of public interest, public order. Kita mo lesser crimes, wala na kasing magnanakaw, wala na nag-holdap. Kasi para yan—bakit itatapon sabi nila eh maliliit lang iyan. Gamitin mo utak mo.

If you are able to contaminate, kagaya ng negosyo ng mga Chinese, wholesale yan sila. Maski konti- konti, kung the whole ng Tondo contaminated, pera yan. I am not saying…the Chinese the practice of itong wholesale/retail. They go wholesale, maski na kumita lang isang piso dyan, okay na iyan. Kasi paramihan eh. Yan ang ibig kong sabihin.

I hope the military and the police will not react on this…it’s part of the deep intelligence that we gathered. I am forced to come and in public kasi iyong mga pari nag-aano. Alam mo, kayong mga media, naghanap kayo ng, “Where is the big fish?” Saan iyong bilyonaryo na mayaman, iyong mga may kotse, may mga Mercedes. Ma’am nandoon yan sila sa labas, wala dito. Magdala ka ng isang battalion na police para hulihin natin doon, kung kaya natin. They direct the traffic of drugs sa kanila. Meron silang ganito, malaki, real time nakikinig sila ngayon dito. I

am 101 percent nakikinig sila dito. Saan doon? Doon lang. Isosoli nila sa Tondo, o itapon mo diyan, tapos umalis ka kunin sa tindahan yung bag o package. Di ba sabi mo nakikita ng media na… kayo lang ang nagba-brand niyan na drug lord eh. Those are not the drug lords, mga lieutenant, delivery boy yan. Kung baga LBC lang yan, pati DHL, Federal.

Pati iyong tawag nilang basura, iyon yung street ano—huwag kayong maghanap. Gusto ninyo sabihin ko sa inyo, puntahan natin. I will give you the names. I’ll show you the intelligence paper. Pero give me the guarantee na may gawain ka. Kasi I will give you the name, I’ll give you country, kung wala pa ring gagawa mag-shotgun tayo—kaya hindi lang kami ‘no. We do not get too personal about our work here. I am saying that I—dito oh, balik na tayo. Kasi iyong hindi nakakaintindi na mga Tagalog, ano na iyong, tagal naman nitong—

Passenger capacity congestion shall be addressed by increasing the number of running trains from the current 16 trains with a total of 48 cars per hour, to 20 trains with a total of 60 cars per hour; increase train speed from 40 (kph) to 60 (kph).

Ang problema nito, iyong mga railways—hindi na ito kasali diyan; huwag kayong maniwala dito. Two- thirds of this are mine, the other third is—korek iyong grammar ko. Ayaw lang nila.

Sixty kilometer per hour, problema nito, and you must agree with me that the rails are quite aged. Most of the rails maybe. Noon pa ‘yan sa panahon ni Marcos, Imelda. Nandiyan pa. Ngayon, sabi ni Tugade, “Sir, magbigay sa akin, sabihin ko 40 to 60 kilometers per hour.” Sabihin ko, “Art, sigurado ka maka- hold ang rail niyan? Baka maputol iyan, magdiretso yung tren sa Cavite. Dumiretso sa Cavite, maglipad, doon kay Tolentino, ‘Oh, bakit may tren dito sa Tagaytay?” It’s quite fast, quite fast, 60 kilometres per hour and you’re pulling something that is heavy. When it really moves … mawalan ng ano … it moves with the speed at a heavy thing at a great speed, mahirap mong … sumasadsad kasi mabigat eh. And reduce headway time from 5 minutes to 3 minutes. Mahina lang tayo ng—ang plano ni Tugade, mahina lang tayo ng one minute sa Hong Kong. Two minutes, kaniya three minutes eh. Art, ambisyoso ka. Kaya mo kaya ito?

Specifically for the LRT, the operating hours shall be extended from 9:30 to 10:30 PM. So marami pang mga bata ang uuwi niyan. And to absorb more passengers, delays in the procurement of additional trains shall be addressed soonest.

Now, iyan ang sinasabi ko. If you want to know me, fine. Wala akong problema. Sabihin ninyo na doon ang … we go the normal way. If you’re able to make purchases.

Ang maganda nito, I have signed the Executive Order sa aming FOI. Naunahan ko kayo. Yung inyo— nandoon na sa akin. Oo, tapos na ako kaya ilabas ko na. It will be out today. Alam ninyo, sabi ko, unahan ko ang Congress puro mayayabang ang ano diyan. We grab the… stealing one’s thunder. Unahan na natin.

So we shall also pursue rail projects in Metro Manila and the major key-points in the country including the Mindanao Rail Project. Hindi ako nagyayabang pero totoo talaga ito. We’re in the—depende sa federal but six years, lalabas talaga ito I assure you because it’s going to materialize. Rail projects, Davao Transit System, the Cebu Transit System, the North and South Luzon Railways and the Panay Railways project.

Panay! Eh taga-saan si ano, di Panay. Panay ang bigay natin para—sabihin naman ni Senator Drilon, bina-backbite ka dito. Lalagyan daw ang island ng train. May tawa pa. Bina-backbite ka

dito. Magsumbong man iyan. Tingnan mo, tan-awa diha.

Different approaches are also being considered to decongest NAIA including the possible transfer of general aviation.

Ang style ko kasi, ganito, hindi naman ako … I am not steeped into formalities. Itong trans- general aviation, alam n’yo kung sino ang tamaan niyan? Kayong mayayaman. Kayong may mga helicopter, pati eroplano, ilipat ko kayo. Alam mo iyong general aviation, iyong mga Lear Jet, iyong sa mga kumpaniya, ilagay ko kayo sa Batanes para wala masyadong air traffic. No. I’m offering Sangley Point. Kasi tayuan ko isang runway ‘yan. I can make a new runway there. Sabi ng mga aviation experts, but tumbok niyan is the Merville Subdivision. Maka isa pa akong runway dito sa Metro Manila. But if not there, it’s going to be Clark but on a condition that you have a fast rail. Sabi ko kay Art, it is something like thirty. One hour of travel, sabi ko kay Tugade, is not acceptable. Make a rail there, bago, marami pa. The bow of the day is bullet train. Ilagay mo iyan sa Pilipino na drayber, sa point ko, hilo. Maglampas kayo dito. The Clark Airport can be utilized to shift some operations of our domestic and international airlines.

Moreover, a one-stop shop will be established within the Clark civil aviation complex for the benefit of the Overseas Filipinos. Ito mangyari na ito. To fully utilize the Clark Airport, it is necessary to establish iyong mga … you have a rail to connect.

In the area of environment, the military is directed to intensify its –makinig kayo, sige gitawa diyan – its support role against illegal logging, illegal mining – andiyan pa naman si Gina Lopez – and other destructive practices that aggravate the devastation of our natural resources. I have to protect the country. Many are complaining against the appointment of Gina Lopez. But si Gina, pati ako, we share the same paradigm: the interest of the country must come first. But hindi ko naman sinasabi—there’s a law allowing mining. Gina Lopez and I are just telling you, follow government standards. Do not destroy the environment. Follow it to a T, wala tayong problema. Just pay the correct taxes; follow the standards.

Gina Lopez is just doing her job. You know she is really a crusader. Iyan ang … that is how I describe her persona: Crusader. Kaya sabi ko tama iyan. Bakit? Nandiyan ba si Ma’am Gina Lopez, Secretary Lopez?

Ganito iyan. Pumunta siya sa Davao, gabi na mga 1 o’clock, because on the early days of my … when I won but hindi pa ako nag-oath. Marami na nagpuntahan — solicitation, congratulations. Eh si Ma’am, pumunta twice. Every time, she shows me the degradation of … ito na nga. Tapos dalawang oras naman, mukhang hindi na matapos. Sabi ko, “Ma’am, do not be offended.” Totoo man, wag kang magagalit kay it’s the truth. So mag-a-alas tres na, “Rody, this one ‘no.” Tapos extemporaneous na, para ring congressman. Sabi ko, “Ma’am, mag-a-alas kuwatro, Ma’am. Ano kaya kung ikaw na lang ang DENR?” Bigla din siyang nag-sagot, “Totoo ka?” Sabi ko, “Umm…” Hindi yung, “oo.” Siya, siya, “I will ask the”…you know, “I’ll consult my family and ask my… ano nila.”

Following day, tawag siya kay, my aide, kay Bong. Sabi niya, “Bong, okay na tinanggap na. Sabi ng pamilya ko, okay na.” Sabi ko, “Haay, bantay ka sa … But you know, I would not be appointing somebody who is alien to my thinking. I would take in somebody who shares my horizons in life, especially iyong degradation …. Tama iyan, she’s a crusader and she will continue.

The DENR is likewise directed to review all permits granted to the mining, logging and other

environmental sensitive activities, ensure compliance with government standards and if warranted — ito na iyong pinakamaganda — amend, suspend or revoke permits. Go ahead.

I’d like to thank God that I had this opportunity, really. I never… wala namang ano, I never thought umabot ako dito. I’ve always had that crank sa isip ko mahirap itong ano.

Gaya itong Laguna Lake, naubos ng mga… wala na ang fishermen. Yun na lang the difference between one big fish pen to the other, iyon na lang ang sa mga tao. Makita mo… sa plane, every time I go to Davao and I pass by that place there. Every time, nakita ko talagang wala nang ano. And the fishermen are complaining about the loss. Talagang wala na sila. Kasi ang maliit na lugar, iyon lang ang kanila. So dito pinadaan ko lang in a diplomatic way that the Laguna Lake shall be transformed into a vibrant economic zone showcasing ecotourism by addressing the negative impact of a watershed destruction, land conversion and pollution. Ito ang nilagay ko. This is what I’m telling you — the poor fishermen will have priority in its entitlements.

Order to Gina is, “Ayusin mo, Ma’am.” Huwag mo namang ipitin, but they have to reduce the areas of occupation. They cannot have their cake and eat it too. Sila na iyong may pera, this must stop. Kung sakaling itanong sa iyo kung sino ang may ari niyan, simple lang — mga General, mga Mayor, Governor, baka Congressman. I mean, this is not personal. This is something which I feel that I must do, because it is the right thing to do.

To have adequate disposal facility for the Metro Manila garbage, the final closure and rehabilitation of the Carmona Sanitary Landfill shall be pursued while the adoption of appropriate waste-to-energy facilities will be explored. Marami iyan, the technology is coming and very fast. In the area of governance there is a need to strengthen our efforts along this line.

To better manage public information, a law should be passed, I’m addressing to Congress, to create the People’s Broadcasting Corporation, replacing PTV-4, the government-run TV station, which now aims to replicate international government broadcasting networks. Teams from these international news agencies – I’d like to mention that, those interested, BBC – are set to visit the country soon to train people from the government-run channels to observe – ito ang gusto ko, total pera naman ng tao – to observe editorial independence through innovative programs and intelligent treatment and analysis of news reports, as well as developments of national and international significance.

The government’s Bureau of Broadcast Services, better known as the Radyo ng Bayan, shall also undergo upgrading to make it financially viable and dependable for accurate, independent, and enlightening news and commentary. Radyo ng Bayan will be integrated with the PBC.

As we are presently setting up a Presidential Communications Satellite Office in Davao City, PBC will also put up broadcast hubs in the Visayas and Mindanao. Davao City will also be the first site of the first Muslim channel, called as Salaam Television, and the first Lumad channel.

The PCO shall coordinate with the Office of the Executive Secretary and the Presidential Legal Counsel in implementing the recently approved EO on the Freedom of Information. This Executive Order is out. As an example, on the part of our Executive Branch to make transparency and integrity as yardsticks in government performance, savings and expenses while engaging the public to a vigilant and to participate in government programs and projects.

The PCO, in coordination with the Office of the Executive Secretary, is drafting the

Administrative Order on the Presidential Task Force on media killings.

This government does not condone violence and repression of media. The bona fide media, bona fide media, sometime they pronounce it bona feed. But whatever that thing is, the bona fide media has always been our partner for change. Di medyo klaro yan. Hindi, anong gawin mo sa hindi bona fide media? Yan ang problema.

To address backlogs and low prosecutorial effectiveness and efficiency, the investigation and case management processes shall be streamlined, including those for illegal drugs and heinous crimes.

To eradicate the prevalent cultures of fear and silence that have hounded our justice system, I ask Congress, you, to enact the Whistleblower Protection Law while the present Witness Protection Program shall be strengthened.

Hirap maging Presidente, maski dito lang.

The number of lawyers and support staff in PAO, that is the Public Assistance [Attorney’s] Office, regional and district offices shall be increased to provide indigents more access to counsels.

At this stage, I also have directed the DILG to undertake nationwide information and campaign on federalism in partnerships with various alliances and with LGUs, civil society, grassroots and faith- based organizations.

Hinto muna ako dito, itong federalism.

Ewan ko kung tama ako. Alam mo itong bayan natin, if I may just repeat, I know that you know it. In 1521 or 1526 Magellan landed in Leyte—Kumare ko man ito, salamat mare ha.

Mindanao was already Islam by 100 years. So ano ito? It’s an imperialism thing. There is a historical injustice committed against the Moro people. We have to correct it, but it is, well, impossible now. Kaya kayong mga kapatid kong mga Moro, alam naman ninyo — ako I’m mixed, migrant ang tatay ko roon, so I’m mixed blood ako, Moro pati Christian. But you know, intindihin na lang natin ito: that we cannot return to you all iyong nakuha ng mga Amerikano, Espanol, pati iyong mga Filipino mga kapitalista, those who exploited Mindanao with that thing, sloganeering, “Go to Mindanao because it is a land of promise.” With the vast entry of so many people, basically coming from the Visayas, nagkaroon tayo ng… we cannot solve it the way you want it to be. You have to understand each other, then you have to live with each other, but we will try.

Ang sinasabi ko lang, babalik ako, dahil ako sa federalism, both Misuari, Sema and all – at least the politico leaders ng Mindanao will agree to it. We do not, remember that ako hindi ko dinidikdik yung masyadong Abu Sayyaf because it is really connected with the first talks between Misuari, the Presidents – subsequently, from President Marcos and now. Until now, until now. The only way they said that we can have this [is] iyong BBL ibigay na natin minus the things that you do not want, iyong mga constitutional issues tanggalin muna natin. Ibigay ko iyong area, nandiyan na iyan eh. So I ask you, pass it minus the constitutional issues that are contentious. Ibigay na natin at when the federal system comes, isali mo na sa package together with Misuari. That is the solution for Mindanao, nothing else. Believe me, nothing else will do. Please sleep on it, ponder on it, because that is the only way to proceed.

On the clamor of our citizens for timely issuance of Philippine passports, the government shall work towards amendment of the 1996 Passport Law to lengthen the validity of the passports from the current 5 years to 10 years. Tutal kayo naman ang maggagawa ng batas, you’re the ones who will pass the law, even if you make it good for 30 years, okay ako. Bahala kayo. Basta stretch a little bit because 5 years is just really simply on a regular basis. Matagal pa naman itong passport. Mag-apply ako ng mga 10 days—

Alam mo, I’d like to call the attention of Secretary Yasay. If you go to Davao, look back doon sa… look at the back, likod ng itong mall, ‘yung malaking mall. Sige, pangalanan na natin – SM. Doon, iyong mga tao nandyan sa pavement natutulog. For the many times nadaan ako na walang ulan, doon yan sila, because first come, first served. And the only outlet there, the outlet of your department is iyong sa SM. So iyong mga—maawa ka roon parang dito sa side ng Cotabato, lahat ng Cotabato doon sa Davao. Karamihan niyan walang mga bahay. You know, if you’re an applicant in Davao City, fine.

But you know kung walang—mahirap kasi ano. Maka-remind yan mga Moroanon, naghihiga sa mga pavement, nasasaktan talaga ako. Masakit eh. Buong gabi maghintay sila hanggang magbukas iyang SM, kasi first come first served. Kaya sabi ko—I’m addressing to all the Cabinet members: make use of the computer. I do not want to see people lining up under the heat of the sun. I do not want to people lining up under the rain na may mga ganun.

And I want itong Labor — wala na ito sa script. Iyong prompter natutulog na siguro ito, papindot- pindot diyan. Alam mo, nandiyan naman iyan. Sabi ko what I want is a journal. When the applicant presents the documents, give them a shopping list. Do not add or get anything away from it. Iyon na iyan, final. And when he complies with that, that is good. Huwag mo na siyang pabalikin. Kasi kung magtawag iyan ng 8888, my God, puntahan ko talaga kayo. ‘Yan ang bisyo ko nung mayor ako. It makes no difference kung mayor-presidente. Puntahan talaga kita at hiyain kita sa maraming tao. And I would publicly ask you what the hell happened to the procedure. Pupuntahan ko talaga kayo.

Local barangay, police, military, lahat, bigyan mo ng shopping list, ‘wag mo lang pabalikin. Because pag magtawag ng 8888 iyan, tapos makita ko na the grievance is valid, bahala ka. Anong walang panahon. Pupuntahan kita sa opisina mo and I would ask you, “bakit?”

Bigyan mo ng stub. You have to employ actuarial ability, that’s easy. Pero pagtanggap mo ng tao — I’m addressing myself, under me — journal, papirmahin mo siya, lagyan mo doon, tignan mo sa computer, magkonek ka doon sa actuarial… hindi naman kailangan ng bobo diyan eh. Kasi matatapos siguro iyan mga next month, tapos na. Projections lang naman. Balik ka dito August 15, 3 o’clock. Pagdating ibigay mo.

Now if he goes to Malacañang and open it up—for those who have valid reasons to complain about graft and corruption, the gates of Malacañang will be open. Doon ka. Magsumbong ka, at I will be briefed by my military or aide or yung si ano – itong nagbigay ng tubig, “Sir, dito marami kang…”

And the reason why I do not go out, I do not accept invitations — hindi ako tumatanggap — because every time I travel around Manila it causes a huge congestion of traffic. Kasi pati itong pag-uwi ko is… they also go by projection — paglabas ni presidente, ano yan picture taking, ganoon and they start to block the… iyong roads access to the… ganoon iyan every time ang President go out, ganoon iyan. So paparahin nila iyan, sabihin nila dadaan iyan by this time, in

the meantime sarado iyan, di paglabas ko kala mo Biyernes Santo, walang sasakyan diyan. Yun pala exponentially ang traffic, the tail-end of the traffic is somewhere, five kilo—and it would take about two to three hours to normalize. Kaya hindi ako tumatanggap nang—and I hate to travel. Kasi talagang lilinisin iyan eh. Ito namang—ang taas kasi ng entourage Presidente silan, dulo sa dulo may ambulansiya. Hindi lang entourage, parang cortege na. Sabi ko dalawa, tatlo tama na, sa gitna lang ako. Pero ang totoo mag-taxi lang ako dito sa likod, sunud lang ako. Eh takot ba sila na… ano ba ang makuha mo kung patayin mo ako? What for? May ambulansiya roon, dagdagan mo na lang punerarya.

I have also ordered the DFA to streamline documentary requirements for passport applications and open additional Consular Offices in strategic locations to decongest Metro Manila sites and avoid queues that have caused hardships and suffering to our passport applicants.

I have also ordered the newly-created DICT, Information and Communication Technology, to develop a National Broadband Plan to accelerate the deployment of fiber optic cables and wireless technologies to improve internet speed. Ito para ito sa… alam ko, Mahal kong mga kababayan maligayahan kayo nito. Pagpaano mo lang yung Tagalog ko, kasi… eh kayo hindi kayo marunong mag-Bisaya, eh di.

Wi-Fi access shall be provided at no charge in selected public places including plazas and parks, public libraries, schools, government hospitals, train stations, airports and seaports. Di ba. Happy lahat.

All government agencies are instructed to enable their clients to submit applications for coordination, other agencies combined. Taas mo, wala na iyan, ayaw mo magsalita. And national portal, yes because it’s our… parang website.

Ito: We shall intensify… mainit talaga ako dito. I place it in parity to drugs. We shall intensify our war against human traffickers and illegal recruiters that prey on our migrants.

To help ensure that the hard-earned money of our Overseas Filipinos are put into productive use, a mandatory financial education for all migrant and their communities shall be pursued along with incentives to encourage entrepreneurship among them.

I may now also ask on Congress to consider drawing up bills consolidating and merging agencies and offices all having to do with Overseas Filipinos to have a department that shall focus on and quickly respond to their problems and concerns.

Kailangan mo ng isa. Ngayon I have asked… I don’t know, Secretary Bello is here? Bebot. Wala? Absinero talaga iyan. Maski sa Cabinet absinero iyan. Gusto ko he will rent or will lease some buildings to be near sa… for overseas only. At lagyan ko na—I will direct all… BIR, lahat na. Lahat ng something to do with the clearances of the police, in one building, may booth lang. I said, “my God make use of the computer.” So doon lang siya mag-ikot sa isang building. Ang Filipino hindi na siya magpunta doon sa Statistics, hindi na magpunta doon sa ano, diyan, diyan sa office na iyan. Gamitin ninyo ang computer and you can get the results right after. Why do he has to travel to Malate, then has to cope with the traffic, he can only accomplish one document at one time.

NBI clearances is doon na ninyo ibigay. Lahat na doon na. At kung dapat… may awa itong si Bello, pakainin ninyo iyong mga tao doon, lalo na sa probinsya. ‘Pag tingin ninyo taga- probinsya, finish it right away. Make use of the computer. Kapag hindi ninyo ginamit iyan, tapon

na lang ninyo. Throw away your computers and I understand that. Make use, do the computers.

To help avoid squatter-like conditions in relocation sites, we urge utilities like Meralco and electric cooperatives to exercise their corporate social responsibility by making direct connections to relocation sites and depressed areas.

Alam mo kung bakit? Hindi na nila nilagyan diyan eh. That’s why I had to talk to you ganito. Bakit? It’s because walang kuryente pagka mahirap ka. You don’t own the land, the City Engineer will not—that is my experience 23 years as mayor. Hindi yan magbigay ng direct connection, kasi hindi ikaw may-ari ng lupa. But that squatter there has been there for 20 years. So mag-connect, connect sila. Pagka-connect- connect nila, ang gamitin nila iyong wire na… iyong pinakamura. So, it overheats because connect- connect na lang sila kung sinong… minsan magnakaw.

You know, we’ll have to make the adjustments. It is not for these people to make the corrections, because they are not in a position to do it. You have to adjust to the needs of our people. Tutal iyan namang… iyang namang squatter na iyan, as long as I sit here as President, there will be no demolitions without relocations. Hindi talaga ako papayag. Hindi naman aso iyan na—just like in Davao. I’d like to make a dialogue with the businessmen, “Sir, how much are you investing in this land, you have bought with the squatter?” So I bought it at about 60 million? Dagdagan mo ng 20 million, ako na ang bahala.

Sabihin ko doon sa mga tao, “bili tayo ng relocation site or I will provide.” Government will expropriate. I will make use of the expropriation powers. Gawa ko ganoon sa Davao eh. I have 20 hectares there. I will expropriate some land there, iyong malapit lang. Then sabihin ko, “this 20 million will help your journey to a new land.” And I will urge everybody, iyong mga bagong mga factories doon sila magtayo.

Magtiis-tiis lang muna kayo. In the meantime, to mitigate the hardships of these people – that’s the only way to do it. Pero instead of demolition, walang matirahan ang tao. Tutal you sat on your rights for many years, eh bakit ngayon pipilitin mo akong magkaproblema ng ganoon. May iba kasi hinahayaan nila for ten, twenty years they do nothing. And when the time comes na… ipagbili lang nila, eh tayo ngayon ang distorbohin. Oh ‘di gumastos ka para mas madali, just add a little bit more and there will be at least peace. ‘Pag hindi, wala iyan… fight na naman iyan between government and the… tawag nila squatters. Squatters naman talaga iyan. Masasaktan lang, mamatay for no reason at all. Eh kung mayaman ka, bigyan mo naman ng konting ano, provide a relocation and I will be glad to talk to the people and say, “go, it is not yours.”

I have directed the concerned regulatory agencies to prioritize the issuance of required permits for power development – Okay iyan sa akin. Ang problema… sandali lang ’to. Para ka diyan. Iyong mga environmentalist, mayroon tayong ano kasi… marami iyong coal, pati iyong—ito nga, itong energy emissions, wala naman akong problema diyan. But do not tell me na if you— ambassador ka tapos sabihin mo sa akin na medyo hanggang diyan kayo, kasi kami hanggang din dito lang kami. Ano? Kayo umabot diyan. You are now in the apex of your industrial might, but along the way you were the first — America, China, Europe. Kayo bongang-bonga, until now it contribute only something point zero.

So if you put so much restrictions doon sa treaty na iyan, the treaty which we are trying to… it’s still here in the Senate. Let us be very clear on this. We need to industrialize. We need the power, and therefore the emissions would also be considered. I just can’t say it. I established five economic zones here and you start to say that—you have spoken so much, carbon

footprints, mahirap iyan. I mean, it’s hard.

I cannot just agree on anything that will delay – I’m only good for six years. I intend to be something during my term. Now, I’m sure that the heavy machineries would come in and even the power. Cheapest is coal. So ito naman locally, you get into trouble with the Gina. So, we’ll just talk sa Cabinet na lang. Si Gina naman is a very fine lady. Huwag ka lang magsimangot sa harapan niya. Bigyan ka niya permit maski lima. Magsimangot ka, zero. All that she is today is just be gracious to her, that’s all. It’s a matter of talking and explaining with her. But if it is the— you are using the state-of-the-art technology, and I’ve seen it several times in the other power plants in this country, if it is really a good one, then we will consider. I said because we need the energy to power our industrialization.

To strengthen the delivery of social services, the government will intensify its social protection programs so it can use its resources and expertise to make a dent in the country’s poverty levels.

What we want is genuinely to reduce vulnerabilities of our people, build resiliency and empower individuals, families and communities.

The beneficiaries of 4Ps shall be made to become independent and self-reliant after they have graduated from the program. We aim to present them with other forms of assistance so that they can stand on their own two feet.

But now, I have decided to direct the DSWD to provide the rice subsidies to the poorest of the families – at least para makakain lang every month. Iyong sako na ano…

We are planning to increase spending for basic education and incorporate mandatory education about the evils of drugs.

We will also intensify and expand the Alternative Learning System programs. The government will also provide universal health insurance for all Filipinos benefits… Sali na lang natin sa PhilHealth.

The professional competence and operational capabilities of government hospitals and health facilities will be strengthened.

Consistent with our international obligations and in keeping with national mandates, this administration vows to protect women’s rights and human rights abuses against our women because it is unacceptable… mambugbog ka ng babae.

Thus, I order all agencies, oversight bodies and local government units down to the barangay level to fully implement the Magna Carta of Women. By doing so, we will ensure that man and woman will truly be partners in the pursuit of the country’s economic, social, cultural and political development.

To our Lumad brothers – and they are here, maybe outside. … outside I’m sure. I told the security to let them come in if they want. Sa kanila man ‘to. To our brothers I have this to say: The government has issued to you Certificates of Ancestral Domain Title covering vast tracts of land especially in the Island of Mindanao. You have the Indigenous Peoples’ Rights Act and the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples to protect and assist you.

The government has given you the legal tool to improve yourselves financially, economically and socially. Make use of your ancestral domain. Do not let it remain idle.

While the government is always ready to help you, you must first help yourself. We cannot legislate financial and economic progress for you. It is you and you alone who can do that. You can chart your fate, but do it within constitutional and legal means.

After being devastated by natural and man-made calamities these past few years, we are still to recover emotionally from the loss of our loved ones, and materially from the loss of our homes and income sources.

There are many among us whose emotional wounds are still fresh and painful to the touch. We cannot erase the images of death and destruction from our minds. We cannot wash away the stench of rotting flesh from our noses. And there are many of us who are still waiting for the help that was promised. The enormity of the problem of drug addiction has been made manifest by the number of surrenderees which grows by the hundreds each day that passes. Since July 1, we have already made 3,600 drug- related arrests. 120 (120,000) drug dependents have already surrendered and 70,000 (7,000) of them are pushers.

You think this is just a… it would take the entire resources of this government to fight this war. I have nothing but the interest of my country. But in its wake — because the PDEA say is that— it’s about— that was a statement made by the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency. Two years ago, PDEA came out with a statement that there are 3 million drug addicts in this country. That was two or three years ago. How do you think would the number, incrementally, if we count now. Give it a liberal addition, maybe… lagyan mo ng seven thousand. So, 3 million 7 hundred thousand. The number is quite staggering and scary. The drug lords that you desperately want to strangle are not here. Walang mga bilyonaryo dito. The ones that you catch, running after are just the lieutenants. They do it by technology. They’re cooking it in the international waters. Tinatapon nila iyan bulto, by the drums, dikitan nila ng GPS. So, makikita agad.

We are hard put sa intelligence, because they’ve invented this direct satellite. Hindi na magdadaan iyan ng… all they have to do is to triangulate where the… pag-ikot niyan. And there’s so many… and they’re in coves. If we do not help from our friends here in Asia and America and Europe, the sheer number and problem, believe me, will drown us as a republic.

Kayo, tignan ninyo ito. How I can I solve the problem now by arresting? Hinahanap ko… matagal na akong Presidente. Gusto kong patayin, ang problema pupunta pa ako doon, then I’ll ask the permission from this country that I will be on because I have to slaughter these idiots for destroying my country. Ganoon iyon eh. Hindi lang kasi naintin—ayaw pa naman bitawan, kasi ayaw naman kasi ng military, pati police.

But you know, I said, I’ll be talking in front of the Republic through its representatives, for the people. So I have to tell you how do we solve this problem? Tell me. Ako naman okay lang eh. Make it public, fine. Make it confidential, if you go to mayor, go to you, to your house, okay. But that is really the enormity of the problem. It’s so enormous that you are intimidated even just to make a move. Because you know you cannot stop it anyway.

Mabunggo mo isa dito, hinulog sa dagat eh marami namang nagluluto doon. It’s a free for all enterprise for the criminals at this time. Kung ako, if I had just the plane and time I could ang sinasabi ko—sabi ko roon sa military, ‘pag nakita ninyo, eh di pasabugin mo. Maski nag- surrender iyan, may white flag, pang-gyera lang iyan hindi iyan pang-kriminal, pasabugin mo.

Show no mercy to them, because they are not doing any mercy to us anyway. Bakit ako mag… iyan ang problema.

But we should not despair. Like someone wrote, it is when the night is darkest that dawn breaks.

We are imbued with resiliency that has been tested and proven more difficult times as in the past. We have to bond and act together. We have to help each other. For then and only then can we truly prevail.

And the Filipino, disciplined, informed and involved, shall rise from the rubbles of sorrow and pain so much so that all the mirrors in the world will reflect the face of a passion that have change this land.

DAGHANG SALAMAT!
